He has a gun but never wears it; he has the power to arrest but never uses it. But then the murder of an elderly North African who fought in the French army changes everything and galvanizes Bruno's attention: the man was found with a swastika carved into his chest.Because of the case's potential political ramifications, a young policewoman is sent from Paris to aid Bruno with his investigation. The two immediately suspect militants from the anti-immigrant National Front, but when a visiting scholar helps to untangle the dead man's past, Bruno's suspicions turn toward a more complex motive.

Meg Langslow is plying her blacksmith's trade at \u201cCaerphilly Days,\u201d a festival inspired by her town\u2019s sudden notoriety as \"The Town That Mortgaged Its Jail.\" The lender has foreclosed on all Caerphilly's public buildings, and all employees have evacuated \u2014except one. Phineas Throckmorton, the town clerk, has been barricaded in the courthouse basement for over a year.Mr. Throckmorton's long siege has only been possible because of a pre-Civil War tunnel leading from the courthouse basement to a crawl space beneath the bandstand. The real reason for Caerphilly Days is to conceal the existence of the tunnel: the tourist crowds camouflage supply deliveries, and the ghastly screeching of the tunnel's rusty trap door is drowned out by as many noisy activities as the locals can arrange. But the lender seems increasingly determined to evict Mr. Throckmorton\u2014and may succeed after one of its executives is found shot, apparently from inside the basement. Meg and her fellow townspeople suspect that someone hopes to end the siege by framing Mr. Throckmorton. Unless the real killer can be found quickly, the town will have to reveal the secret of the tunnel\u2014and the fact that they've been aiding and abetting the basement\u2019s inhabitant. Meg soon deduces that the killer isn't just trying to end the siege but to conceal information that would help the town reclaim its buildings--if the townspeople can find it before the lender destroys it in a gut-busting caper that will have giggles and guffaws coming as fast as a four-alarm fire.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327925943i/13142993.jpg", "genres": ["Audiobook", "Adult Fiction", "Cozy Mystery", "Fiction", "Mystery", "Mystery Thriller", "Adult", "Humor", "Animals", "Contemporary"], "asin": "125000750X", "isbn": "125000750X", "isbn13": "9781250007506", "publisher": "St. Martin's Minotaur", "series": ["Meg Langslow"], "author": ["Donna Andrews"], "publishDate": 1342508400000, "ratingHistogram": [25, 90, 837, 1476, 1212], "ratingsCount": 3640, "reviewsCount": 348, "numPages": 344, "language": "English"}

In medieval Cambridge, England, four children have been murdered. The crimes are immediately blamed on the town's Jewish community, taken as evidence that Jews sacrifice Christian children in blasphemous ceremonies. To save them from the rioting mob, the king places the Cambridge Jews under his protection and hides them in a castle fortress. King Henry II is no friend of the Jews-or anyone, really-but he is invested in their fate. Without the taxes received from Jewish merchants, his treasuries would go bankrupt. Hoping scientific investigation will exonerate the Jews, Henry calls on his cousin the King of Sicily-whose subjects include the best medical experts in Europe-and asks for his finest \"master of the art of death,\" an early version of the medical examiner. The Italian doctor chosen for the task is a young prodigy from the University of Salerno. But her name is Adelia-the king has been sent a \"mistress\" of the art of death. Adelia and her companions-Simon, a Jew, and Mansur, a Moor-travel to England to unravel the mystery of the Cambridge murders, which turn out to be the work of a serial killer, most likely one who has been on Crusade with the king. In a backward and superstitious country like England, Adelia must conceal her true identity as a doctor in order to avoid accusations of witchcraft. Along the way, she is assisted by Sir Rowley Picot, one of the king's tax collectors, a man with a personal stake in the investigation. Rowley may be a needed friend, or the fiend for whom they are searching. As Adelia's investigation takes her into Cambridge's shadowy river paths and behind the closed doors of its churches and nunneries, the hunt intensifies and the killer prepares to strike again . .", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1435958507i/86643.jpg", "genres": ["Medieval", "British Literature", "Fiction", "Mystery", "Historical", "Mystery Thriller", "Thriller", "Historical Fiction", "Historical Mystery", "Crime"], "asin": "0399154140", "isbn": "0399154140", "isbn13": "9780399154140", "publisher": "G.P.

There was nothing left standing of the barn, it had burned completely to the ground.

Unnoticed, among these ruins, were the burned remains of Aaron Nunamaker, owner of \u2018Nunamaker Stables\u2019, and one of the best known horse breeders and stud farm owners in West Tennessee.Killing a human being brings the wrath of the law and the accompanying sorrow and grief from loved ones. Killing a helpless animal brings wrath that is unequaled to that associated with killing a person. This sorrow and grief continues long after the grief over human loss has left. Mankind will forget their own losses, but they never forget similar betrayals to animals. Odd isn\u2019t it?The fire had, obviously, been set and was a deliberate murder of innocent animals - horses. Horses, that could not free themselves from their comfortable stable, horses that trusted their caregiver and felt safe in their home. Horses that died a terrible death, and horses that would never know how they became involved in such a terrible scheme and plan.Tracks reveled that many of the doomed horses had been led from another barn to the one that was burned. This made it more than an act of revenge or rage, but one intended to destroy the animals, all at once, and all at one time.Other than car and horse tracks, the clues were minimal or non-existent. Police roped off the area and considered it an accident or a rival/revenge act, until they found the body. Then things changed.He had been shot once at close range with a high powered rifle.

While Violet sought out the spotlight, her sister Sasha always had to be the responsible one, taking over their mother's hair salon and building a quiet life for her beloved daughter, Quinn.

He isn't the only one wondering what secrets she might be keeping: Quinn, loyal to the aunt she always idolized, is doing her own investigating.

Karen Owen Mystery BloggerAuthor \"Vicki Vass takes me back to the first mysteries I ever read\u2026Nancy Drew.\" By Lisa Ks Book Reviews \"There were so many twists and turns that I was not able to figure out who did it until the end of the book. I like that because it makes me want to read faster to see what happens next\" Griperang's Bookmarks A cross genre mix of historical fiction and paranormal mystery, Bloodline by Vicki Vass is the first book in her A Witch Cat Mystery series. Set in two different locations; Salem, Massachusetts during the witch trials of the early 1690; s and contemporary Ashville, North Carolina, Ms. Vass uses the local folklore of both locations to build her story. Well-developed characters, two interesting mysteries and a solid pace kept me turning the pages from start to finish. While there are two separate mysteries, only one will be resolved by the end of the story. The secondary mystery will undoubtedly be something that is carried as an ongoing thread throughout the series. Ms. Vass does a good job dropping clues for the reader to gather and the story takes plenty of twists and turns. The story\u2019s pace is fairly quick and Ms. Vass\u2019s voice as an author is well established and easy to read.

He and his wife had been relocated to a one horse hick town in West Tennessee, with a promise to start life over - on the right side of the law, this time.His factory job lasted less than a year. A strike and major labor dispute had cost him his job - and his running around with other women had cost him his wife. He never intended for any of this to happen, but it seemed he was meeting failure at every turn. He had made that difficult move from the underworld to the real world with all good intentions of making it stick - it wasn't working. Things were dragging him back, and he was finding it too easy to drift into the dark side of life once again. He knew that if he crossed back over, all chances and opportunity for a life in the real world were over - his one chance gone forever. While he resisted, it just didn't seem to matter - circumstances were taking him back - he couldn't stop himself.He started by renewing some old contacts, asking the right questions and finally by offering his services for hire. It didn't take long for things to happen, and contract offers coming his way.They started with a call from Anthony 'Tony' Scarsetti. He had worked for Tony in the past, and he believed they held a mutual respect for each other - him for his skills and Tony for his leadership. Tony was a rival of Steve Carrollton, and their competition for the vices in Memphis and on Beale Street was well known. Evidently, Carrollton had been temporarily sidelined - but his operations continued. Tony was looking for some professional help to make his temporary situation a permanent one.Once again in his life, things were looking up and he was feeling good about himself - being useful. His skills were needed and he would again be a contributor. His little house on Mullins Avenue, in this hick town of Humboldt, would also be useful. Quiet, out of the main activity in Memphis, and allowing him to operate under the radar. Besides, the government had bought it, why not put it to good use?He would start by sharpening the skills that had once made him successful. After all, failure was not an option in this business - only death. Hours in the local forests and woods would give him the privacy required - he had the perfect set-up and the perfect location. Nobody local to challenge him, and besides, if someone did - he was still the best at what he did. Everybody knew that.~The tickets arrived to his post office box in a medium size brown envelope. American Airlines First Class to Miami and a First Class Cabin for a cruise to the Bahamas. It also contained $5,000 in large bills - more would be paid when the job was complete. He'd never been on a cruise before. In fact, the largest boat he'd ever been on was one he and his brother used for cat fishing when he was a kid. Things were good again. He wasn't going to make the same mistakes he had made in the past. At the top of his game he was the best, and he intended to be at the top of his game.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1417387084i/20234667.jpg", "asin": "B005G5V8IW", "publisher": "cr Press", "series": ["Carson Reno "], "author": ["Gerald W.

Only eight years after serving out a prison sentence for murder, Socrates Fortlow lives in a tiny, two-room Watts apartment, where he cooks on a hot plate, scavenges for bottles, drinks and wrestles with his demons. Struggling to control a seemingly boundless rage--as well as the power of his massive \"rock-breaking\" hands--Socrates must find a way to live an honourable life as a black man on the margins of a white world, a task which takes every ounce of self-control he has.  Easy Rawlins fans might initially find themselves disappointed by the absence of a mystery to unravel. But it's a gripping inner drama that unfolds over the pages of these stories, as Socrates comes to grips with the chaos, poverty and violence around him. He tries to get and keep a job delivering groceries; takes in a young street kid named Darryl, who has his own murder to hide; and helps drive out the neighbourhood crack dealer. Throughout, Mosley captures the rhythms of Watts life in prose both lyrical and hard-edged, resulting in a haunting look at a life bounded by lust, violence, fear and a ruthlessly unsentimental moral vision.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348622123i/84557.jpg", "genres": ["African American", "Audiobook", "Noir", "Fiction", "Mystery", "Novels", "Mystery Thriller", "Short Stories", "Crime", "Literary Fiction"], "asin": "1852427027", "isbn": "1852427027", "isbn13": "9781852427023", "publisher": "Serpent's Tail", "series": ["Socrates Fortlow"], "author": ["Walter Mosley"], "publishDate": 852105600000, "characters": ["Socrates Fortlow"], "ratingHistogram": [19, 110, 678, 1720, 1699], "ratingsCount": 4226, "reviewsCount": 351, "numPages": 208, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Anisfield-Wolf Book Award", "awardedAt": 883641600000, "category": null, "hasWon": null}]}

It was an extremely difficult delivery, and the baby, a boy, lived for only two days. According to the doctor, the baby was born with a serious heart defect, which could not have been prevented. He assured Tammy that her work, activities and personal care had nothing to do with the death of the baby \u2013 she didn\u2019t believe him. Neither did Sonny.That was the end for Tammy and Sonny. They never forgave themselves and they never forgave each other.Tammy\u2019s job at Alton Box was gone and now she needed something to keep herself busy and away from Sonny. Her brother, Richie, told her that \u2018Skeeter\u2019s\u2019 in Jackson was looking for some inside and outside waitresses, and Tammy couldn\u2019t get there fast enough to complete an application. \u2018Skeeter\u2019s\u2019 is a restaurant similar to Chiefs, except they don\u2019t offer rooms or cabins for rent. They do offer inside dining, a bar and outside curb service \u2013 just like Chiefs. What they offered Tammy was a way to get away from Sonny, Humboldt and the bad memories. What it also offered was an opportunity to meet other people, lots of people. For Tammy, it was also a chance to meet other men, and she did a lot of that.It was two days before anyone reported Tammy missing. Sunday and Monday were her days off and she always spent Monday visiting with her parents. When she missed her Monday visit, her father, Thomas Whitmore, called her house all day \u2013 no answer. He finally reached Sonny that afternoon, and Sonny told him that she had changed her work schedule and was working. Her father didn\u2019t accept that answer, and Mr. Whitmore called the sheriff\u2019s office to report Tammy as missing. The sheriff\u2019s office collected information and made the usual and necessary calls. However, when she didn\u2019t report for her shift at \u2018Skeeter\u2019s\u2019 on Tuesday, her boss called her father to inquire about her absence. That\u2019s when her father learned Tammy had definitely not worked on Monday, and in fact, had not worked since the previous Saturday.Tammy had not been seen by anyone since finishing her shift at \u2018Skeeter\u2019s\u2019 at 1:00 AM Saturday night; however, it didn\u2019t take long for the sheriff, Leroy Epsee, and his deputies to find Tammy.Crossing Rexall Drug Store, owned by Dr. Parker Williams and Dr. Whitley Johnson, is just around the corner from \u2018Blue\u2019s Pool Room\u2019. \u2018Blue\u2019s Pool Room\u2019 is a popular hangout for many of the residents of the \u2018Crossing\u2019, and many of the male colored citizens of Humboldt grew up inside the walls of \u2018Blue\u2019s Pool Room\u2019. While the poolroom and the drug store don\u2019t have much in common, they do share a trash dumpster located in the alley area behind both businesses. It was here where they found Tammy.Jack Cooley, better known as \u2018Jack the Rack\u2019, worked at \u2018Blue\u2019s Pool Room\u2019 as a rack boy and \u2018step and fetch-it\u2019 for most of the patrons. It was his weekly responsibility to make sure all the trash was placed in the alley garbage dumpster for Tuesday\u2019s collection day. Behind the dumpster, among all the discarded boxes and trash, is where he found Tammy Blurton. She was naked, except for an extremely bloodstained, short sleeve, blue work shirt with \u2018Henry\u2019 on the red name label above the left pocket. Tammy had been beaten, strangled, stabbed and presumably raped. It would be four days before the coroner could determine the exact cause of death.Leroy\u2019s crime scene investigators did a good job and eventually located a large knife among the scattered trash bags. It was an eight- inch, butcher-type knife and had what appeared to be bloodstains on the blade. They also found a small slip of paper in the pocket of the shirt Tammy was wearing; it contained a name and phone number.Henry Walker SUnset 4 \u2013 2031.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1613499907i/23637279.jpg", "asin": "B00Q72YSW6", "series": ["Carson Reno "], "author": ["James H.

However unlikely, it's soon discovered that this unfortunate corpse was not done in by his precipitous plunge but instead from an arrow fatally lodged in his chest. Unraveling the twisted web of intrigue that took the man's life requires the expert skills of Haxford's brilliant and sartorially splendid Chief Inspector Pignon Scorbion.But the quirky detective is not alone in this task. Aiding Scorbion in his dogged pursuit of truth and justice are his carefully chosen deputies: six quirky and unconventional thinkers from the town who meet regularly with Scorbion in Calvin Brown's barbershop to unmask ne'er-do-wells and solve local crimes. Since his move to the charming village, the enigmatic detective has also realized his growing dependence upon its bookshop's owner. Lovely and quick-witted Thelma Smith not only helps Pignon with his criminal cases, but she seems well on her way to unlocking the mysteries of his heart.Not everyone in Haxford is so cooperative.

Her carefully constructed existence, post-divorce, begins to crumble as the widow of one of the victims refuses to leave her alone, her ex-husband begins stalking her and Ben\u2019s sexy crime fighting skills cause a mild anxiety attack.

Growing up in India, she learned the importance of responsibility, honor, and duty from her officer father. At the outbreak of World War I, Bess volunteered for the nursing corps, serving from the battlefields of France to the doomed hospital ship Britannic.On one voyage, Bess grows fond of the young, gravely wounded Lieutenant Arthur Graham.

Charleston antique shop owner Abigail Timberlake (a.k.a. Mrs. Greg Washburn) knows the importance of not mixing business and private life -- that's why she has two names, for crying out loud. But when Mrs. Washburn's best friend, Wynell, begs for a part in Ms. Timberlake's new venture -- redecorating a very upscale bed-and-breakfast -- Abby breaks that cardinal rule and agrees. Since Abby deals with interiors, and Wynnell is to handle the garden, personal and professional peace is maintained, at least until Abby points out the utter tastelessness of the replica of Michelangelo's David that Wynnell has chosen for the garden's focal point. After exchanging heated words, as only southern ladies can, the pair stop speaking to each other entirely -- until Wynnell calls Abby from jail, where she's under arrest for fatally attacking the B&amp;B owner with the tacky statue! Wynnell's taste in garden sculpture may be deplorable, but that's hardly a criminal offense. To prove her friend's innocence, Abby turns her finely honed research skills on the other suspects at the scene of the crime, like the not-so-grieving widower or the strange guests. Until justice is done, Abby refuses to be distracted by her personal tribulations, which include her mother's decision to open a tearoom in Abby's home and the return of her prodigal brother, who is sporting a clerical collar and aggressively brandishing the new leaf he's supposedly turned over. Statue of Limitations is a wickedly funny, fast-paced look at southern lifestyles of the rich and dead.

A romantic getaway at a rustic Christmas tree farm is just what she needs. But the property's mysterious past has her feeling less than merry. . . Liss is surprised when an old friend from high school asks her to spend a week at the Christmas tree farm she recently inherited from a great-uncle. Realizing it would be the perfect chance for her and her husband Dan to get away from work, Liss happily accepts the offer and packs her bags for the tiny town of New Boston. Upon their arrival, Liss and Dan are greeted by a ramshackle farmhouse and unfriendly townsfolk. It's hardly the idyllic vacation locale they'd hoped for, especially when needling neighbors start raising questions about the farm's dark history. Who was the man whose body was found neatly netted in a shipment of Scotch pine? Why did the owner vanish into thin air? And why are the trees growing so close together, forming a maze more twisted than a Celtic knot? The rumors pile up faster than snowdrifts in a blizzard, and as Liss starts un-wrapping the truth, she discovers something even more scandalous than murder hiding beneath the town's humdrum facade. When a series of \"accidents\" strikes the farm, she'll have to spring into action faster than a Highland Fling to find the killer who's been lurking among the pines--before she ends up in a pine box herself. . .", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1397422773i/20702337.jpg", "genres": ["Christmas", "Holiday", "Murder Mystery", "Cozy Mystery", "Mystery", "Fiction", "Romance"], "asin": "075829283X", "isbn": "075829283X", "isbn13": "9780758292834", "publisher": "Kensington", "series": ["Liss MacCrimmon Mysteries"], "author": ["Kaitlyn Dunnett"], "publishDate": 1414479600000, "ratingHistogram": [6, 67, 248, 258, 150], "ratingsCount": 729, "reviewsCount": 104, "numPages": 304, "language": "English"}

Sadly, she won't remain ignorant of the suspiciously high mortality rate among her fellow antiques dealers for long.Rumors are everywhere. The most recent victim, John Smithson, died of poison at a show just last week, and many of the same dealers are here at Rensselaer. They make the identical circuit year after year, so they know each other well. Or do they?Murder is still far from Maggie's mind as she arranges her Shadows booth: some Currier &amp; Ives prints here, Winslow Homer wood engravings on the hack wall, other prints arranged on tables and easels by category. With eleven years' experience, she knows her stock. So far the worst thing that has happened was putting the wrong price tag on a Homer engraving and having to sell it for $170 instead of $1,700.Maggie doesn't intend for that to happen again, and she doesn't intend to worry about murder. This show's security is tight. But she can't help observing her colleagues with fresh eyes. Some, Eke Gussie White in the booth next door, are dear friends, and Gussie's assistant, her twenty-year-old nephew, Ben, who has Down's syndrome, is a delightful new acquaintance. Others, however, even people she's known for years, suddenly seem suspect.The opening night wine has hardly stopped flowing when death claims another victim. Maggie will still sell a few antique prints, but she'll spend most of her time looking for a killer and trying to save a vulnerable young friend. Will Maggie herself become a potential victim? The answer may be in one of Maggie's prints, but she has hundreds in her booth.

Serenity Adams is the newly elected young sheriff in the country town of Blood Rock and besides dealing with the threatening behavior of her predecessor, she now has a dead Amish girl on her plate.

As Peter Theroux in the New York Times Book Review points out, \"Her wonderfully witty voice and her penchant for history lessons of the Nile both ancient and modern keep [her] high adventure moving for even the highest brows.\" In her previous outing, The Last Camel Died at Noon, Amelia Peabody and her dashing husband, Emerson, discovered a fabulous lost oasis in the Nubian desert. Now, in the seventh mystery in the series, the Emerson-Peabodys are traveling up the Nile once again to encounter their most deadly adversary, the Master Criminal, who is back at his sinister best. Amelia Peabody was unabashedly proud of her newest translation, a fragment of the ancient fairytale \"The Doomed Prince.\" Later, she would wonder why no sense of foreboding struck her as she retold the story of the king's favorite son who had been warned that he would die from the snake, the crocodile, or the dog. Little did she realize, as she and her beloved husband sailed blissfully toward the pyramids of ancient Egypt, that those very beasts (and a cat as well) would be part of a deadly plot. The expedition began so happily....Leaving their delightful, but catastrophically precocious, son, Ramses, back in England, Amelia hoped this romantic trip might rejuvenate her thirteen-year-old marriage and bring back the thrills that she feared were fading. She and her dear Emerson were returning to the remote desert site where they had first fallen in love, Amarna, the holy city of Akhenaton and his beautiful queen, Nefertiti. But their return would threaten not only their marriage, but their very lives with perils as chilling as a mummy'scurse.

Red-hot screwball comedies, each and every one of them. Nine of these stories were originally published by the Loveswept line between the years 1988 and 1992. All immediately went out of print and could be found only at used bookstores and yard sales.I'm excited to tell you that those nine stories are now being re-released by HarperCollins. Naughty Neighbor is the eighth in the lineup, and it's presented here in almost original form. Usually when I edit these books I do some modernizing. For instance, I change VHS to DVD, and roller skates to Rollerblades, and sticks of gum are now pieces of gum. I do this because the books were meant to be contemporary (as opposed to historical), and I don't want the reader to have a time disconnect. In the beginning of the original Naughty Neighbor, my heroine throws a handheld phone into the toilet, and the next morning she goes into the bathroom and sees the \"slim silver antenna caught between the toilet lid and seat.\" Okay, so most phones don't have extended antennas anymore, but I just loved the image . . . so I left it in. And I don't know how many women wear front-closure bras anymore, but that got left in, too.Naughty Neighbor is probably the most romancey of all the Loveswepts I wrote, but there's still a small mystery to unravel. Louisa Brannigan is a no-nonsense, hardworking press secretary, fighting her way to the top of Capitol Hill, with no help from her annoying neighbor, Pete Streeter. He receives phone calls all night long, he steals her morning paper, he thinks jeans are formal wear, and worst of all he's involved Louisa in the disappearance of a pig. So this is the story of a pig in Witness Protection and love being found by a workaholic woman and a fun-loving man who makes terrible pots of coffee.Enjoy!Janet Evanovich", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388327293i/1577167.jpg", "genres": ["Audiobook", "Romance", "Comedy", "Fiction", "Mystery", "Chick Lit", "Adult", "Contemporary Romance", "Humor", "Contemporary"], "asin": "0060598921", "isbn": "0060598921", "isbn13": "9780060598921", "publisher": "Harper", "author": ["Janet Evanovich"], "publishDate": 1204012800000, "characters": ["Louisa Brannigan", "Pete Streeter"], "places": ["Washington, D.C."], "ratingHistogram": [264, 1367, 4494, 3888, 3613], "ratingsCount": 13626, "reviewsCount": 637, "numPages": 229, "language": "English"}

And it comes from an unlikely source-Captain Daniel Sullivan, a New York City police detective and erstwhile beau of Molly's. She has vowed to keep him at arm's length until he can rid himself of his socialite fiancee, but she can't pass up the chance to take advantage of his offer of a real detective job. Daniel hires Molly to go undercover inside the country household of Senator Barney Flynn, in Peekskill, New York. Flynn's wife, Theresa, has become the latest devotee of a pair of spiritualists known as the Sorensen Sisters. The frail Theresa is desperate to use the sisters' alleged abilities to hold a seance to contact her infant son, who was kidnapped five years ago and never found; the accused kidnapper was killed before he could tell police where the boy was being held. But the police are sure the women are frauds. When Molly allows herself to be distracted from the Sorensen Sisters and the members of the Flynn household by the unsolved kidnapping, it is a race against time to find out what's really going on before it's too late. \"In Like Flynn \"is the latest captivating installment in a series which has garnered an impressive array of awards and nominations in just three books: Rhys Bowen's Molly Murphy mysteries have won the Agatha Award, the Anthony Award, the Bruce Alexander Historical Award, and the Herodotus Award, and have been shortlisted for the Agatha Award, the Macavity Award, and the Mary Higgins Clark Award.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1390173644i/626065.jpg", "genres": ["Audiobook", "Cozy Mystery", "Fiction", "Mystery", "Historical", "Mystery Thriller", "Historical Fiction", "Romance", "Historical Mystery", "Crime"], "asin": "0312997000", "isbn": "0312997000", "isbn13": "9780312997007", "publisher": "St. Martin's Paperbacks", "series": ["Molly Murphy"], "author": ["Rhys Bowen"], "publishDate": 1133251200000, "ratingHistogram": [41, 132, 1492, 3257, 2568], "ratingsCount": 7490, "reviewsCount": 405, "numPages": 321, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Macavity Award", "awardedAt": 1136102400000, "category": "Sue Feder Historical Mystery", "hasWon": null}]}

She's got a PBS cooking gig for a few weeks, and is trying to build a reputation as a personal chef, but she's desperate for a little extra Christmas cash, so she agrees to sell a pair of vintage skis to Doug Portman, a local art critic and former sort-of-romantic interest.  When Portman's killed in a skiing accident at Killdeer Resort with Goldy nearby, the police treat her with suspicion. It turns out that Portman was the easily persuaded head of the Parole Board, and Goldy's ex-husband (a.k.a. The Jerk, who was imprisoned for domestic violence) is coming up for parole. But when Goldy herself narrowly escapes a chilly death after her van is forced off a snowy highway, she starts looking for connections and steps into a minefield of unsolved murders, including the three-year-old avalanche death of her friend Nate Bullock. There're a multitude of suspicious characters lurking around Killdeer: Barton Reed, a crazy ex-con who sent Portman a letter loaded with poison; Arthur Wakefield, whose wealthy mother was also killed in a skiing accident at Killdeer; Jack Gilkey, a handsome young chef who was convicted of manslaughter in the death of Wakefield's mother (and released by Portman); Boots Faraday, a local artist; and even Rorry Bullock, Nate's angry widow. As usual, Goldy manages to solve the murders (with the help of Chocolate Coma Cookies), save her own skin (just!), skewer a few local snobs in passing, and revive her catering business.

Liz digs in to find a motive for murder, but she\u2019s besieged with distractions. Her ex has marriage and babies on his mind. Her too-sexy partner engages in a campaign of repeat seduction. Mamma needs help with Daddy\u2019s devotion to bad habits. And a gang of wild hogs is running loose on Stella Maris.  With the heat index approaching triple digits, Liz races to uncover a diabolical murder plot in time to save not only Calista\u2019s life, but also her own.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1370886768i/18053731.jpg", "genres": ["Detective", "Southern", "Cozy Mystery", "Fiction", "Mystery", "Paranormal Mystery", "Paranormal", "Chick Lit", "Whodunit", "Romance"], "asin": "1938383567", "isbn": "1938383567", "isbn13": "9781938383564", "publisher": "Henery Press", "series": ["Liz Talbot Mystery"], "author": ["Susan M.

During the divorce proceedings, he and Evelyn signed a child custody bond, and Steven is demanding the money guaranteed by the bond to find Annie. The money was secured by a mortgage on Evelyn's grandmother's house, and the True Blue Bonds Bail Agency wants to take possession of the house.Finding a kidnapped child is not an assignment for a bounty hunter. But Evelyn's grandmother lives next door to Stephanie's parents, and Stephanie's mother and grandmother are not about to see their neighbor lose her house because of abduction.Even though Stephanie's plate is full with miscreants who missed their court dates, including old nemesis and violent drunk Andy Bender and an elusive little old lady accused of grand theft auto, she can't disappoint Grandma Mazur!

The answer was a resounding 'I am not happy' for a jealous wife who suspects her husband of infidelity, for a lonely widow driven to assume a new identity, for a distraught mother whose son has been kidnapped, and for a strangely reclusive bride-to-be. But what sort of detective would solicit in the personal column? The sort who has a knack for investigating affairs of the heart. For therein lie the darkest motives for murder. And they are proving most lucrative for the hopelessly romantic, and highly suspicious, Parker Pyne.The 12 stories are: 1. The Case of the Middle-Aged Wife, 2. The Case of the Discontented Soldier, 3. The Case of the Distressed Lady, 4. The Case of the Discontented Husband, 5. The Case of the City Clerk, 6. The Case of the Rich Woman, 7. Have You Got Everything You Want?, 8. The Gate of Bagdad, 9. The House at Shiraz, 10. The Pearl of Price, 11. Death on the Nile, and 12. The Oracle at Delphi. Librarian's note #1. the short story, Death on the Nile in this compilation starring Parker Pyne, should not be mistaken with the novel, Death on the Nile starring Hercule Poirot. Both by Christie.Librarian's note #2: there are two more Parker Pyne stories in other collections. The stories are titled: 'The Regatta Mystery' and 'Problem at Pollensa Bay'. Including these two, there are 14 Pyne stories for your reading pleasure.Librarian's note #3: this is the entry for the collection of 12 short stories, \"Parker Pyne Investigates' ('Mr. Parker Pyne, Detective'). Entries for each of the individual stories are located elsewhere on Goodreads. All 14 can be found by searching Goodreads for: 'a Parker Pyne Short Story'.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309305177i/278237.jpg", "genres": ["Detective", "Audiobook", "Murder Mystery", "British Literature", "Fiction", "Mystery", "Mystery Thriller", "Short Stories", "Classics", "Crime"], "asin": "0007154828", "isbn": "0007154828", "isbn13": "9780007154821", "publisher": "Harper Collins Publishers Ltd", "series": ["Ariadne Oliver", "Parker Pyne"], "author": ["Agatha Christie"], "publishDate": 1041840000000, "characters": ["Mr. Parker Pyne", "Madeleine de Sara", "Claude Luttrell", "Ariadne Oliver", "Miss Lemon"], "places": ["Middle East", "London, England"], "ratingHistogram": [413, 1463, 5835, 6433, 5399], "ratingsCount": 19543, "reviewsCount": 1138, "numPages": 320, "language": "English"}

Most of his best agents have left or been transferred out of the Homicide Department; his old friend and lieutenant Jean-Guy Beauvoir hasn't spoken to him in months; and hostile forces are lining up against him. When Gamache receives a message from Myrna Landers, in the village of Three Pines, he welcomes the chance to get away from the city for a few hours. Myrna's longtime friend, who was due to spend Christmas in the village, has failed to arrive. When Chief Inspector Gamache presses for information, Myrna is reluctant to reveal her friend's name. Mystified, Gamache soon discovers the missing woman was once one of the most famous people not just in North America but in the world, and now goes unrecognized by virtually everyone except the mad, brilliant poet Ruth Zardo. As events come to a head at the S\u00fbret\u00e9, Gamache is drawn ever deeper into the world of Three Pines. Increasingly, he is not only investigating the disappearance of Myrna's friend but also seeking a safe place for himself and his still-loyal colleagues\u2014if such a refuge exists amid mounting danger.

{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/129780.Hamlet", "title": "Hamlet", "titleComplete": "Hamlet", "description": "Perhaps the single most influential work of English drama, William Shakespeare's Hamlet is a timeless tragedy of the conflicted loyalties, madness, betrayal and terrible revenge. This Penguin Shakespeare edition is edited by T.J.B. Spencer with an introduction by Alan Sinfield. 'To be or not to be - that is the question' Something is rotten in the state of Denmark. When young prince Hamlet is confronted by his father's ghost on the battlements of Castle Elsinore, he is burdened with a terrible task: slay King Claudius, Hamlet's uncle, who the ghost alleges murdered him. Wrestling with his conscience, Hamlet feigns wild madness while plotting a brutal revenge, alienating his mother Queen Gertrude and spurning his lover Ophelia. But the act of insanity takes Hamlet perilously close to the reality, wreaking havoc on guilty and innocent alike. This book contains a general introduction to Shakespeare's life and Elizabethan theatre, a separate introduction to Hamlet, a chronology, suggestions for further reading, an essay by Paul Prescott discussing performance options on both stage and screen, and a commentary. William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was born to John Shakespeare and Mary Arden some time in late April 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon.

Before he can show them to Nicholas Brisbane, the private inquiry agent he has retained for his protection, Sir Edward collapses and dies at his London home, in the presence of his wife, Julia, and a roomful of dinner guests.  Prepared to accept that Edward's death was due to a long-standing physical infirmity, Julia is outraged when Brisbane visits and suggests that Sir Edward has been murdered. It is a reaction she comes to regret when she discovers the damning paper for herself, and realizes the truth. Determined to bring her husband's murderer to justice, Julia engages the enigmatic Brisbane to help her investigate Edward's demise. Dismissing his warnings that the investigation will be difficult, if not impossible, Julia presses forward, following a trail of clues that lead her to even more unpleasant truths, and ever closer to a killer who waits expectantly for her arrival.

To have the perfect Christmas had been a childhood dream whilst surviving a rough upbringing in a Birmingham slum. Holly berries glistened, snow fell gently outside, and inside, all was Dickensian jollity. And in her dreams, James Lacey kissed her under the mistletoe, and, like a middle-aged sleeping beauty, she would awake to passion once more....\n  \n  Agatha Raisin is bored. Her detective agency in the Cotswolds is thriving, but she'll scream if she has to deal with another missing cat or dog. Only two things seem to offer potential excitement: the upcoming Christmas festivities and her ex, James Lacey. This year she is sure that if she invites James to a really splendid, old-fashioned Christmas dinner, their love will rekindle like a warm Yule log. When a wealthy widow hires Agatha because she's convinced a member of her family is trying to kill her, Agatha is intrigued---especially when the widow drops dead after high tea at the manor house. Who in this rather sterile house, complete with fake family portraits, could have hated the old lady enough to poison her? Agatha sets out to find the murderer, all the while managing a pretty, teenage trainee who makes her feel old and planning for a picture-perfect Christmas, with James, all the trimmings, and perhaps even snow.\n", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388607680i/509007.jpg", "genres": ["Christmas", "Detective", "Audiobook", "Holiday", "Murder Mystery", "Cozy Mystery", "British Literature", "Mystery", "Fiction", "Crime"], "asin": "0312349114", "isbn": "0312349114", "isbn13": "9780312349110", "publisher": "Minotaur Books", "series": ["Agatha Raisin "], "author": ["M.C.

Their first caper, The Spellman Files, was a New York Times bestseller and earned comparisons to the books of Carl Hiaasen and Janet Evanovich. Now the Spellmans, a highly functioning yet supremely dysfunctional family of private investigators, return in a sidesplittingly funny story of suspicion, surveillance, and surprise.   When Izzy Spellman, PI, is arrested for the fourth time in three months, she writes it off as a job hazard. She's been (obsessively) keeping surveillance on a suspicious next door neighbor (suspect's name: John Brown), convinced he's up to no good -- even if her parents (the management at Spellman Investigations) are not.   When the (displeased) management refuses to bail Izzy out, it is Morty, Izzy's octogenarian lawyer, who comes to her rescue. But before he can build a defense, he has to know the facts. Over weak coffee and diner sandwiches, Izzy unveils the whole truth and nothing but the truth -- as only she, a thirty-year-old licensed professional, can.   When not compiling Suspicious Behavior Reports on all her family members, staking out her neighbor, or trying to keep her sister, Rae, from stalking her \"best friend,\" Inspector Henry Stone, Izzy has been busy attempting to apprehend the copycat vandal whose attacks on Mrs. Chandler's holiday lawn tableaux perfectly and eerily match a series of crimes from 1991-92, when Izzy and her best friend, Petra, happened to be at their most rebellious and delinquent. As Curse of the Spellmans unfolds, it's clear that Morty may be on retainer, but Izzy is still very much on the case...er, cases -- her own and that of every other Spellman family member.

This quaint town seems to be the perfect new home for Max, who has fled a harrowing past serving in the British counter-intelligence agency, the MI5. Now he has found a measure of peace among urban escapees and yoga practitioners, artists and New Agers. But this serenity is quickly shattered when the highly vocal and unpopular president of the Women\u2019s Institute turns up dead at the Harvest Fayre. The death looks like an accident, but Max\u2019s training as a former agent kicks in, and before long he suspects foul play. Max has ministered to the community long enough to be familiar with alliances and animosities among the residents, but this tragedy confounds him. It is impossible to believe anyone in his lovely hamlet capable of the crime, and yet given the victim, he must acknowledge that almost everyone in town had probably fantasized about the poor woman\u2019s death. As Max becomes more intricately involved, the investigation stirs up memories he\u2019d rather not revisit; the demons from his past which led him to Nether Monkslip and the reason why he is so heavily invested in keeping it from harm. Agatha-award winning author G.M. Malliet first won over the mystery community with her St. Just trilogy, prompting critics to compare her to Golden Age greats like Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers.

But when her boss, Milo, simultaneously cuts her bartending hours and introduces her to a \"friend\" looking for a private eye, Izzy reluctantly finds herself with a new client. She assures herself that the case -- a suspicious husband who wants his wife tailed -- will be short and sweet, and will involve nothing more than the most boring of PI rituals: surveillance. But with each passing hour, Izzy finds herself with more questions than hard evidence.Meanwhile, Spellmania continues. Izzy's brother, David, the family's most upright member, has adopted an uncharacteristically unkempt appearance and attitude toward work, life, and Izzy. And their wayward youngest sister, Rae, a historic academic underachiever, aces the PSATs and subsequently offends her study partner and object of obsession, Detective Henry Stone, to the point of excommunication. The only unsurprising behavior comes from her parents, whose visits to Milo's bar amount to thinly veiled surveillance and artful attempts (read: blackmail) at getting Izzy to return to the Spellman Inc. fold.As the case of the wayward wife continues to vex her, Izzy's personal life -- and mental health -- seem to be disintegrating. Facing a housing crisis, she can't sleep, she can't remember where she parked her car, and, despite her shrinks' persistence, she can't seem to break through in her appointments. She certainly can't explain why she forgets dates with her lawyer's grandson, or fails to interpret the come-ons issued in an Irish brogue by Milo's new bartender.

But when a family reunion takes a deadly turn, it's up to Hannah to find a killer. . .Between baking up a storm for The Cookie Jar and unraveling the mystery of her cat Moishe's recent strange behavior, Hannah Swensen has a lot on her plate. But she'll always make time for her business partner, Lisa, who's in the midst of preparing for a big family reunion. Everyone is delighted when Lisa's long-lost uncle makes a surprise appearance. No one has heard from Gus in twenty-five years--and his arrival has everyone buzzing with excitement. Uncle Gus is immediately the hit of the reunion, telling tales of his great success and flashing money for all to see. He's almost as popular as Hannah's scrumptious carrot cake, which is also Gus's favorite dessert. But the next morning, as the whole family gathers for the group photo, one person is missing. Hannah offers to track down Uncle Gus, but her search leads to a shocking find. Over by the bar at the pavilion, she spots two slices of her infamous carrot cake, frosting-side down on the floor--and Gus's corpse with an ice pick jutting out of his chest! A little snooping reveals that not everyone was celebrating Gus's return. And when Hannah unearths more secrets from Gus's past, she discovers even more people with an axe to grind.

Invading people's privacy comes naturally to Izzy. In fact, it comes naturally to all the Spellmans. If only they could leave their work at the office. To be a Spellman is to snoop on a Spellman; tail a Spellman; dig up dirt on, blackmail, and wiretap a Spellman. Part Nancy Drew, part Dirty Harry, Izzy walks an indistinguishable line between Spellman family member and Spellman employee. Duties include: completing assignments from the bosses, aka Mom and Dad (preferably without scrutiny); appeasing her chronically perfect lawyer brother (often under duress); setting an example for her fourteen-year-old sister, Rae (who's become addicted to \"recreational surveillance\"); and tracking down her uncle (who randomly disappears on benders dubbed \"Lost Weekends\"). But when Izzy's parents hire Rae to follow her (for the purpose of ascertaining the identity of Izzy's new boyfriend), Izzy snaps and decides that the only way she will ever be normal is if she gets out of the family business.

Her latest outing with Professor Peter Shandy, New England's famous horticulturist and homegrown hercule Poirot, takes us to the Maine coast, a world of stormy seas and verdant gardens where dark and bright are strangely mixed... and where secrets abound. Peter Shandy has journeyed northward alone to escape his wife Helen's all-female house party and to go in search of some mysterious lupines - glorious great spikes of bloom that are reportedly growing where conditions should make their existence impossible. He takes a room at a quaint old inn in Pickwance, Maine, and is awaiting a serving of Indian pudding in the dining room when the town's most disliked citizen, Jasper Flodge, keels over, face first, into his chicken pot pie. Foul play is soon suspected - especially since everyone in Pickwance feels that while Jasper never finished his main course, he got his just desserts. Shandy, however, is more intrigued by another enigma. He has located the lupines at an ancient farm owned by Frances Hodgson Rondel, a woman of great age and fixed opinions. Her plants are inexplicably lush, her hens are in glowing health, and she herself is as spry as a woman of forty. Could it be something in the soil - or in the bubbling spring that Miss Rondel guards from prying eyes? And whose voice did Shandy hear shouting threats as he came up the nearly impassable drive?

{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28534228-snatched", "title": "Snatched", "titleComplete": "Snatched (Diana Hunter #2)", "description": " What would you do if you discovered a dead body? Would you investigate? Try to solve the case before the police arrive?  Would you prattle on about theories regarding the murder, realizing you know almost too much about it? Would you put the handsome detective off balance so that he then accuses you of being the murderer? All before 9AM? No\u2026 surely no one would do that?  Clearly, you haven\u2019t met Diana Hunter.  When embarking on an early morning run, Diana notices a man sitting on the ground reading a book. When she returns, she finds he hasn\u2019t moved a muscle since she left her house. She checks him over and discovers that he is stone cold. Once the emergency services arrive, all equipped with a very good-looking, but pompous detective, Peter Hopkinson, she has to continually prove to the detective why she is not the killer while trying to solve the murder herself.  Will Diana find the murderer before the detective does, or will they both discover that something a lot more sinister is going on at Royal Bay Beach?   Interview with the Author of the Series  Q - So, what makes the Diana Hunter series special?  A - When I set out to write these books, I wanted to create something that mirrored exactly the kind of books I like to read. My top picks are always mystery novels, especially featuring female protagonists with attitude. Diana is badass and I can\u2019t tell you how many readers tell me she reminds them of themselves. She makes you feel you can do anything!  The Diana Hunter books are a great mix of genres. There is nothing graphic or gratuitous in these books. Your Aunt Martha could definitely read them. But they are not \u201croses around the cottage door\u201d \u2013type mysteries. They are more hard-boiled with some romantic tension, suspense and thriller action to keep things interesting!  Overall, the Diana Hunter series is designed to keep you turning the pages - and I've made sure there's never a dull moment.  Q - In what order should I read the books?  A - The Diana Hunter mysteries can be read and enjoyed in any order, however, Hunted is a prequel to the other books in the series. Unlike the other books, it is not a complete mystery. It relates the events that create the backdrop to the series and fills in some of Diana\u2019s personality and motivations. You don\u2019t have to have read the prequel to make sense of the later books but it helps.  I\u2019ve made sure not to include any spoilers for those who are new to the characters and any existing fans of Diana\u2019s adventures will still find plenty of fresh action and mystery as well as perhaps a few answers. All in all, there is something for everyone. The events in this prequel take place a few years before Snatched, the first book in the Diana Hunter series of mysteries.  If you do want to read them in order, I'd suggest the following sequence:  - Hunted (prequel) - Snatched - Stolen - Chopped  Q - So, why should readers give these books a try?  A - Because the Diana Hunter series is a fast, fun, thrill-ride that takes no prisoners! Our heroine is kicks butt but has a soft center. We want her to win out even when she\u2019s making poor decisions and alienating those who can, and want, to help her. I think most women will see a little, or a lot, of themselves in Diana Hunter.  Ultimately, readers who enjoy lightning-fast pacing with a plot that twists and turns all the way to the end will get a kick out of this series.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1452706140i/28534228.jpg", "genres": ["Murder Mystery", "Amazon", "Fiction", "Mystery", "Thriller", "Mystery Thriller", "Suspense"], "series": ["Diana Hunter "], "author": ["Gabriella Zinnas", "Alison Golden"], "publishDate": 1452412800000, "ratingHistogram": [19, 51, 136, 215, 242], "ratingsCount": 663, "reviewsCount": 97, "numPages": 136, "language": "English"}

A threat.When Vancouver's elite convenes in the prestigious Four Seasons Hotel to celebrate and fund the new British Columbia Children's Hospital, it is a night of free flowing champagne, high class regalia and more flash than a museum could house - until suddenly everyone realizes all their precious jewels and baubles are gone.In the space of one moment the night turns from joy to confusion.... How did it happen? How were they all robbed, at once... without anyone seeing a thing?Diana Hunter works for a news and crime magazine, yet her past experience and impressive, Sherlock Holmes-like skills mark her as an asset only the government could have trained.Those skills are soon put to the test when the Superintendent of the Vancouver Police Department calls her in to work the case. Thrown together with a talented group, Diana must unravel the clues before the ghost like bandits strike again. With two successful heists behind them, Diana begins to fear the bigger picture and realizes that these 'robberies' may not just be robberies after all....Interview with the Author of the seriesQ - So, what makes the Diana Hunter series special?A - When I set out to write these books, I wanted to create something that mirrored exactly the kind of books I like to read. My top picks are always mystery novels, especially featuring female protagonists with attitude. Diana is badass and I can't tell you how many readers tell me she reminds them of themselves. She makes you feel you can do anything!The Diana Hunter books are a great mix of genres. There is nothing graphic or gratuitous in these books. Your Aunt Martha could definitely read them. But they are not \"roses around the cottage door\" -type mysteries. They are more hard-boiled with some romantic tension, suspense and thriller action to keep things interesting!Overall, the Diana Hunter series is designed to keep you turning the pages - and I've made sure there's never a dull moment.Q - In what order should I read the books?A - The Diana Hunter mysteries can be read and enjoyed in any order, however, Hunted is a prequel to the other books in the series. Unlike the other books, it is not a complete mystery. It relates the events that create the backdrop to the series and fills in some of Diana's personality and motivations. You don't have to have read the prequel to make sense of the later books but it will help to understand the sub plot more clearly.I've made sure not to include any spoilers for those who are new to the characters and any existing fans of Diana's adventures will still find plenty of fresh action and mystery as well as perhaps a few answers. All in all, there is something for everyone. The events in this prequel take place a few years before Snatched, the first book in the Diana Hunter series of mysteries.If you do want to read them in order, I'd suggest the following sequence:Hunted (prequel) Snatched Stolen (coming soon) Chopped (coming soon) Q - So, why should readers give these books a try?A - Because the Diana Hunter series is a fast, fun, thrill-ride that takes no prisoners! Our heroine kicks butt but has a soft center. We want her to win out even when she's making poor decisions and alienating those who can, and want, to help her. I think most women will see a little, or a lot, of themselves in Diana Hunter.Ultimately, readers who enjoy lightning-fast pacing with a plot that twists and turns all the way to the end will get a kick out of this series.Thanks for reading!", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1479939857i/31334462.jpg", "genres": ["Fiction", "Mystery", "Suspense", "Mystery Thriller"], "asin": "1530979285", "isbn": "1530979285", "isbn13": "9781530979288", "publisher": "CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform", "series": ["Diana Hunter "], "author": ["Gabriella Zinnas", "Alison Golden"], "publishDate": 1469775600000, "ratingHistogram": [13, 28, 126, 183, 238], "ratingsCount": 588, "reviewsCount": 82, "numPages": 224, "language": "English"}

Lavinia is also well versed in the practice of mesmerism, an extraordinary gift that far surpasses mere charm and physical appeal. Nobody knows this better than the usually coolheaded Tobias March, who seems to have fallen hopelessly under her spell. Fortunately for all, however, Lavinia uses her powers for good. And ever since a tragedy involving one of her subjects, she has even retired them in favor of her work with Lake and March, a joint venture providing \u201cdiscreet private inquiries for individuals of quality.\u201d Celeste Hudson, the stunningly beautiful young wife of a family friend and fellow mesmerist, would surely count herself among such individuals--were she still alive, that is. While mythology\u2019s Medusa could turn men to stone, lovely Celeste was more accustomed to turning them to jelly. In fact, unbeknownst to her husband, Howard, the ambitious Celeste was planning to use her talents to forge a new future in Society--one that would not include him. Sadly, her plans were cut short when she was murdered. Only a gentleman\u2019s cravat wound around her lovely neck remained for evidence--small compensation for the strange and priceless bracelet that may have been snatched from her wrist as she drew her last breath.As a result, Lake and March are soon in Howard Hudson\u2019s employ on the trail of the killer. But Tobias is convinced the dashing widower is more interested in tracking down the missing relic. If so, Howard is not alone. Any number of ruthless types are after the very same antiquity, whose centerpiece is an unusual blue cameo of inestimable value and supposed legendary powers--powers of immeasurable worth to anyone in Howard\u2019s line of work.Together, Lake and March undertake a tantalizing investigation that leads them from the glittering ballrooms of the ton to London\u2019s seediest taverns to a mesmerist whose therapies include treating ladies suffering from \u201chysteria\u201d is a a most unconventional method--and, not least of all, to the darkest reaches of men\u2019s psyches.
