Cal Newport,English,"A New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestsellerFrom New York Times bestselling author Cal Newport comes a bold vision for liberating workers from the tyranny of the inbox--and unleashing a new era of productivity.Modern knowledge workers communicate constantly. Their days are defined by a relentless barrage of incoming messages and back-and-forth digital conversations--a state of constant, anxious chatter in which nobody can disconnect, and so nobody has the cognitive bandwidth to perform substantive work. There was a time when tools like email felt cutting edge, but a thorough review of current evidence reveals that the ""hyperactive hive mind"" workflow they helped create has become a productivity disaster, reducing profitability and perhaps even slowing overall economic growth. Equally worrisome, it makes us miserable. Humans are simply not wired for constant digital communication.We have become so used to an inbox-driven workday that it's hard to imagine alternatives. But they do exist. Drawing on years of investigative reporting, author and computer science professor Cal Newport makes the case that our current approach to work is broken, then lays out a series of principles and concrete instructions for fixing it. In A World without Email , he argues for a workplace in which clear processes--not haphazard messaging--define how tasks are identified, assigned and reviewed. Each person works on fewer things (but does them better), and aggressive investment in support reduces the ever-increasing burden of administrative tasks. Above all else, important communication is streamlined, and inboxes and chat channels are no longer central to how work unfolds.The knowledge sector's evolution beyond the hyperactive hive mind is inevitable. The question is not whether a world without email is coming (it is), but whether you'll be ahead of this trend. If you're a CEO seeking a competitive edge, an entrepreneur convinced your productivity could be higher, or an employee exhausted by your inbox, A World Without Email will convince you that the time has come for bold changes, and will walk you through exactly how to make them happen.","['Self Help', 'Audiobook', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Technology', 'Leadership', 'Business', 'Productivity', 'Nonfiction', 'Management']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1597016311i/54326146.jpg,0525536558,9780525536550,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54326146-a-world-without-email,320.0,3.89,666.0,A World Without Email: Reimagining Work in an Age of Communication Overload,5493.0

Mark R. Levin,English,"The six-time #1 New York Times bestselling author, Fox News star, and radio host Mark R. Levin explains how the dangers he warned against in the timely yet timeless (David Limbaugh, author of Jesus Is Risen) bestseller Liberty and Tyranny have come to pass. In 2009, Mark R. Levin galvanized conservatives with his unforgettable manifesto Liberty and Tyranny, by providing a philosophical, historical, and practical framework for halting the liberal assault on Constitution-based values. That book was about standing at the precipice of progressivisms threat to our freedom and now, over a decade later, were fully over that precipice and paying the price. In American Marxism, Levin explains how the core elements of Marxist ideology are now pervasive in American society and culturefrom our schools, the press, and corporations, to Hollywood, the Democratic Party, and the Biden presidencyand how it is often cloaked in deceptive labels like progressivism, democratic socialism, social activism, and more. With his characteristic trenchant analysis, Levin digs into the psychology and tactics of these movements, the widespread brainwashing of students, the anti-American purposes of Critical Race Theory and the Green New Deal, and the escalation of repression and censorship to silence opposing voices and enforce conformity. Levin exposes many of the institutions, intellectuals, scholars, and activists who are leading this revolution, and provides us with some answers and ideas on how to confront them.  As Levin writes: The counter-revolution to the American Revolution is in full force. And it can no longer be dismissed or ignored for it is devouring our society and culture, swirling around our everyday lives, and ubiquitous in our politics, schools, media, and entertainment. And, like before, Levin seeks to rally the American people to defend their liberty.","['History', 'Politics', 'Cultural', 'Audiobook', 'Sociology', 'American', 'Philosophy', 'American History', 'Nonfiction', 'Society']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1624319161i/57873303.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57873303-american-marxism,317.0,4.18,548.0,American Marxism,3857.0

Miranda Devine,English,"As seen onTucker Carlson Tonight! USA Today and Wall Street Journal Bestseller!  The inside story of the laptop that exposed the presidents dirtiest secret.When a drug-addled Hunter Biden abandoned his waterlogged computer at a Mac repair shop in Delaware in the spring of 2019, just six days before his father announced his candidacy for the United States presidency, it became the ticking time bomb in the shadows of Joe Bidens campaign. The dirty secrets contained in Hunters laptop almost derailed his fathers presidential campaign and ignited one of the greatest media coverups in American history. This is the unvarnished story of whats really inside the laptop and what China knows about the Bidens, by the New York Post journalist who brought it into the open. It exposes the coordinated censorship operation by Big Tech, the media establishment, and former intelligence operatives to stifle the New York Posts coverage, in a chilling exercise of raw political power three weeks before the 2020 election. A treasure trove of corporate documents, emails, text messages, photographs, and voice recordings, spanning a decade, the laptop provided the first evidence that President Joe Biden was involved in his sons ventures in China, Ukraine, and beyond, despite his repeated denials. This intimate insight into Hunters dissolute lifestyle shows he was incapable of holding down a job, let alone being paid tens of millions of dollars in high-powered international business deals by foreign interests, unless he had something else of value to sellwhich of course he did. He was the son of the vice president who would go on to become the leader of the free world.","['Crime', 'History', 'Politics', 'Government', 'Audiobook', 'American History', 'The United States Of America', 'Biography', 'True Crime', 'Nonfiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1619801229i/57902342.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57902342-laptop-from-hell,252.0,4.39,429.0,"Laptop from Hell: Hunter Biden, Big Tech, and the Dirty Secrets the President Tried to Hide",3816.0

She couldn't change, even if she wanted to.So when she finds herself thinking more about cute, quiet Talia Sanchez than the loss of a perfect prom with her ex-boyfriend, seeds of doubt take root in Ophelia's firm image of herself. Add to that the impending end of high school and the fracturing of her once-solid friend group, and things are spiraling a little out of control. But the course of love--and sexuality--never did run smooth. As her secrets begin to unravel, Ophelia must make a choice between clinging to the fantasy version of herself she's always imagined or upending everyone's expectations to rediscover who she really is, after all.","['Young Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Queer', 'Lesbian', 'LGBT', 'Romance', 'Young Adult Contemporary', 'Coming Of Age', 'Contemporary', 'Fiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1615485431i/56978109.jpg,1250797306,9781250797308,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56978109-ophelia-after-all,341.0,4.08,2762.0,Ophelia After All,10186.0

Mauro F. Guilln,English,"Once upon a time, the world was neatly divided into prosperous and backward economies. Babies were plentiful, workers outnumbered retirees, and people aspiring towards the middle class yearned to own homes and cars. Companies didn't need to see any further than Europe and the United States to do well. Printed money was legal tender for all debts, public and private. We grew up learning how to ""play the game,"" and we expected the rules to remain the same as we took our first job, started a family, saw our children grow up, and went into retirement with our finances secure.That worldand those rulesare over.By 2030, a new reality will take hold, and before you know it:- There will be more grandparents than grandchildren- The middle-class in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa will outnumber the US and Europe combined- The global economy will be driven by the non-Western consumer for the first time in modern history- There will be more global wealth owned by women than men- There will be more robots than workers- There will be more computers than human brains- There will be more currencies than countriesAll these trends, currently underway, will converge in the year 2030 and change everything you know about culture, the economy, and the world.According to Mauro F. Guillen, the only way to truly understand the global transformations underwayand their impactsis to think laterally. That is, using peripheral vision, or approaching problems creatively and from unorthodox points of view. Rather than focusing on a single trendclimate-change or the rise of illiberal regimes, for exampleGuillen encourages us to consider the dynamic inter-play between a range of forces that will converge on a single tipping point2030that will be, for better or worse, the point of no return.2030 is both a remarkable guide to the coming changes and an exercise in the power of lateral thinking, thereby revolutionizing the way you think about cataclysmic change and its consequences.","['Environment', 'Politics', 'Social Science', 'Technology', 'Economics', 'Business', 'Futurism', 'Nonfiction', 'Finance', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1593380722i/49127551.jpg,1250268176,9781250268174,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49127551-2030,288.0,3.71,296.0,2030: How Today's Biggest Trends Will Collide and Reshape the Future of Everything,2198.0

As well as being a bestselling author, Jackson spent much of her adult life as a mother of four in Vermont, and the landscape here is often the everyday: raucous holidays and trips to the dentist, overdue taxes and frayed lines of Christmas lights, new dogs, and new babies. But in recounting these events to family, friends, and colleagues, she turns them into remarkable stories: entertaining, revealing, and wise. At the same time, many of these letters provide fresh insight into the genesis and progress of Jackson's writing over nearly three decades.""The novel is getting sadder. It's always such a strange feelingI know something's going to happen, and those poor people in the book don't; they just go blithely on their ways.""Compiled and edited by her elder son, Laurence Jackson Hyman, in consultation with Jackson scholar Bernice M.

Ari Fleischer,English,"Media consultant and former Bush Administration Press Secretary Ari Fleischer accuses American journalism of becoming the domain of the woke young urban elite--a class which has no respect or tolerance for dissenting views.According to Ari Fleischer, there is a new elite in America--the Journalist Class. Today's mainstream media is dominated by younger, urban college grads who write stories for younger, urban college grads. These journalists haven't just slanted the media. They've pulled the whole Democrat party over to their own worldview, he contends.This is the true source of anger in the country and the growing sense that media elites look down on everyone else. Because they do. If you're older or not urban or not a college grad, the Journalist Class doesn't think you're worth impressing. But there's a problem for progressives--the Journalist Class's point of view does not persuade enough people to win elections. Before 2016, they tried to appeal to those citizens living in what they call ""flyover country,"" but after 2016 they began writing only for each other.The way this narrow worldview has constricted news and cultural language is intellectually impoverishing for a country as diverse and varied as the United States.

"Lisa Mosconi, Maria Shriver",English,"""In The XX Brain, Lisa meticulously guides us in the ways we can both nourish and protect ourselves, body and mind, to ensure our brains remain resilient throughout our lives.""--from the foreword by Maria Shriver The first book to address cognitive enhancement and Alzheimer's prevention specifically in women--and to frame brain health as an essential component of Women's Health.In this revolutionary book, Dr. Lisa Mosconi, director of the Women's Brain Initiative at Weill Cornell Medical College, provides women with the first plan to address the unique risks of the female brain.Until now, medical research has focused on ""bikini medicine,"" assuming that women are essentially men with breasts and tubes. Yet women are far more likely than men to suffer from anxiety, depression, migraines, brain injuries, and strokes. They are also twice as likely to end their lives suffering from Alzheimer's disease, even when their longer lifespans are taken into account. But in the past, the female brain has received astonishingly little attention and was rarely studied by medical researchers-- resulting in a wealth of misinformation about women's health.The XX Brain confronts this crisis by revealing how the two powerful X chromosomes that distinguish women from men impact the brain first and foremost and by focusing on a key brain-protective hormone: estrogen.Taking on all aspects of women's health, including brain fog, memory lapses, depression, stress, insomnia, hormonal imbalances, and the increased risk of dementia, Dr. Mosconi introduces cutting-edge, evidence-based approaches to protecting the female brain, including a specific diet proven to work for women, strategies to reduce stress, and useful tips for restorative sleep. She also examines the controversy about soy and hormonal replacement therapy, takes on the perils of environmental toxins, and examines the role of our microbiome. Perhaps best of all, she makes clear that it is never too late to take care of yourself.The XX Brain is a rallying cry for women to have full access to information regarding what is going on in their brains and bodies as well as a roadmap for the path to optimal, lifelong brain health.","['Womens', 'Neuroscience', 'Self Help', 'Medicine', 'Nutrition', 'Feminism', 'Health', 'Nonfiction', 'Medical', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1565069986l/52674038.jpg,0593083113,9780593083116,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52674038-the-xx-brain,368.0,4.0,254.0,The XX Brain,2092.0

Though incidence of these conditions is skyrocketing, for the past four decades standard treatment hasn't much changed, and success rates in treating them have barely improved, either.

Ocean Vuong,English,"In this deeply intimate second poetry collection, Ocean Vuong searches for life among the aftershocks of his mother's death, embodying the paradox of sitting within grief while being determined to survive beyond it. Shifting through memory, and in concert with the themes of his novel On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous, Vuong contends with personal loss, the meaning of family, and the cost of being the product of an American war in America. At once vivid, brave, and propulsive, Vuong's poems circle fragmented lives to find both restoration as well as the epicenter of the break.The author of the critically acclaimed poetry collection Night Sky With Exit Wounds, winner of the 2016 Whiting Award, the 2017 T.S. Eliot Prize, and a 2019 MacArthur fellow, Vuong writes directly to our humanity without losing sight of the current moment. These poems represent a more innovative and daring experimentation with language and form, illuminating how the themes we perennially live in and question are truly inexhaustible.

Shannon Burke,English,"
  From the acclaimed author of 
  
    Black Flies
  
   and 
  
    Into the Savage Country
  
  , a powerful new novel of class striving and the precarious dynamics of brotherhood in the Chicago suburbs of the late 1970s.
""In our family, there was none of this crap about everyone being a winner,"" says Willie, the narrator, who looks back on his teen years--and his nearly mortal combat with his domineering older brother, Coyle. In the Brennan house four kids sleep in a single room, and are indoctrinated into ""The Methods,"" a system of achievement and relentless striving, laced with a potent, sometimes violent version of sibling rivalry. The family is overseen by a raging bull of a father, a South Side tough guy who knocks them sideways when they don't perform well or follow his dictates. Rivals, enemies, and allies, the siblings contend with one another and their wealthy self-satisfied peers at New Trier, the famous upscale high school where the family has struggled to send them. Evoking their crucible of class struggle and peer pressures, Burke balances comedy, tragedy, and a fascinating cast of characters, delivering a book that reads like an instant classic--an unforgettable story of the intertwining of love and family violence, and of triumphant teen survival that echoes down through the years.","['Historical Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Coming Of Age', 'Contemporary', 'Fiction', 'Family']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1596113145i/54755937.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54755937-the-brother-years,205.0,4.09,44.0,The Brother Years,140.0
Bjrn Lomborg,English,"Hurricanes batter our coasts. Wildfires rage across the American West. Glaciers collapse in the Artic. Politicians, activists, and the media espouse a common message: climate change is destroying the planet, and we must take drastic action immediately to stop it. Children panic about their future, and adults wonder if it is even ethical to bring new life into the world. Enough, argues bestselling author Bjorn Lomborg. Climate change is real, but it's not the apocalyptic threat that we've been told it is. Projections of Earth's imminent demise are based on bad science and even worse economics. In panic, world leaders have committed to wildly expensive but largely ineffective policies that hamper growth and crowd out more pressing investments in human capital, from immunization to education. False Alarm will convince you that everything you think about climate change is wrong -- and points the way toward making the world a vastly better, if slightly warmer, place for us all.","['Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Technology', 'Climate Change', 'Economics', 'Global Warming', 'Environment', 'Nonfiction', 'Ecology', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1590426614i/49089453.jpg,1541647467,9781541647466,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49089453-false-alarm,320.0,4.19,358.0,"False Alarm: How Climate Change Panic Costs Us Trillions, Hurts the Poor, and Fails to Fix the Planet",2275.0
Stephen Graham Jones,English,"Winner of the Bram Stoker Award for Best NovelIn her quickly gentrifying rural lake town Jade sees recent events only her encyclopedic knowledge of horror films could have prepared her for in this latest chilling novel that will give you nightmares. The good kind, of course ( BuzzFeed ) from the Jordan Peele of horror literature, Stephen Graham Jones.Some girls just dont know how to dieShirley Jackson meets Friday the 13th in My Heart Is a Chainsaw , written by the New York Times bestselling author of The Only Good Indians Stephen Graham Jones, called a literary master by National Book Award winner Tananarive Due and one of our most talented living writers by Tommy Orange.Alma Katsu calls My Heart Is a Chainsaw a homage to slasher films that also manages to defy and transcend genre. On the surface is a story of murder in small-town America. But beneath is its beating heart: a biting critique of American colonialism, Indigenous displacement, and gentrification, and a heartbreaking portrait of a broken young girl who uses horror movies to cope with the horror of her own life.Jade Daniels is an angry, half-Indian outcast with an abusive father, an absent mother, and an entire town that wants nothing to do with her. She lives in her own world, a world in which protection comes from an unusual source: horror movies especially the ones where a masked killer seeks revenge on a world that wronged them. And Jade narrates the quirky history of Proofrock as if it is one of those movies. But when blood actually starts to spill into the waters of Indian Lake, she pulls us into her dizzying, encyclopedic mind of blood and masked murderers, and predicts exactly how the plot will unfold.Yet, even as Jade drags us into her dark fever dream, a surprising and intimate portrait emergesa portrait of the scared and traumatized little girl beneath the Jason Voorhees mask: angry, yes, but also a girl who easily cries, fiercely loves, and desperately wants a home. A girl whose feelings are too big for her body. My Heart Is a Chainsaw is her story, her homage to horror and revenge and triumph.","['Horror', 'Paranormal', 'Audiobook', 'Mystery', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Contemporary', 'Adult Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Fiction', 'Adult']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1608145153i/56312400.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56312400-my-heart-is-a-chainsaw,412.0,3.55,7616.0,My Heart Is a Chainsaw,37143.0

Kurt Andersen,English,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER  When did America give up on fairness? The author of Fantasyland tells the epic history of how America decided that big business gets whatever it wants, only the rich get richer, and nothing should ever changeand charts a way back to the future. Essential, absorbing . . . a graceful, authoritative guide . . . a radicalized moderates moderate case for radical change.The New York Times Book ReviewDuring the twentieth century, America managed to make its economic and social systems both more and more fair and more and more prosperous. A huge, secure, and contented middle class emerged. All boats rose together. But then the New Deal gave way to the Raw Deal. Beginning in the early 1970s, by means of a long war conceived of and executed by a confederacy of big business CEOs, the superrich, and right-wing zealots, the rules and norms that made the American middle class possible were undermined and dismantled. The clock was turned back on a century of economic progress, making greed good, workers powerless, and the market all-powerful while weaponizing nostalgia, lifting up an oligarchy that served only its own interests, and leaving the huge majority of Americans with dwindling economic prospects and hope.Why and how did America take such a wrong turn? In this deeply researched and brilliantly woven cultural, economic, and political chronicle, Kurt Andersen offers a fresh, provocative, and eye-opening history of Americas undoing, naming names, showing receipts, and unsparingly assigning blameto the radical right in economics and the law, the high priests of high finance, a complacent and complicit Establishment, and liberal useful idiots, among whom he includes himself.Only a writer with Andersens crackling energy, deep insight, and ability to connect disparate dots and see complex systems with clarity could make such a book both intellectually formidable and vastly entertaining. And only a writer of Andersens vision could reckon with our current high-stakes inflection point, and show the way out of this man-made disaster.","['History', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Economics', 'Sociology', 'American', 'Business', 'American History', 'Nonfiction', 'Political Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1590669209i/53562067.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53562067-evil-geniuses,430.0,4.22,438.0,Evil Geniuses: The Unmaking of America,3136.0

Yet Donovan struggled to make a living in an industry where male chefs built successful careers on the stories, recipes, and culinary heritage passed down from generations of female cooks and cooks of color. At one of her career peaks, she made the perfect dessert at a celebration for food-world goddess Diana Kennedy. When Kennedy asked why she had not heard of her, Donovan said she did not know.

Sesali Bowen,English,"From funny and fearless entertainment journalist Sesali Bowen, Bad Fat Black Girl combines rule-breaking feminist theory, witty and insightful personal memoir, and cutting cultural analysis for an unforgettable, genre-defining debut.Growing up on the south side of Chicago, Sesali Bowen learned early on how to hustle, stay on her toes, and champion other Black women and femmes as she navigated Blackness, queerness, fatness, friendship, poverty, sex work, and self-love.Her love of trap music led her to the top of hip-hop journalism, profiling game-changing artists like Megan Thee Stallion, Lizzo, and Janelle Monae.But despite all the beauty, complexity, and general badassery she saw, Bowen found none of that nuance represented in mainstream feminism. Thus, she coined Trap Feminism, a contemporary framework that interrogates where feminism and hip-hop intersect.Notes from a Trap Feministoffers a new, inclusive feminism for the modern world. Weaving together searing personal essay and cultural commentary, Bowen interrogates sexism, fatphobia, and capitalism all within the context of race and hip-hop. In the process, she continues a Black feminist legacy of unmatched sheer determination and creative resilience.Bad bitches: this ones for you.","['Gender', 'Audiobook', 'Queer', 'Essays', 'Memoir', 'LGBT', 'Race', 'Feminism', 'Nonfiction', 'Adult']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1615845067i/56554628.jpg,0063028700,9780063028708,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56554628-bad-fat-black-girl,272.0,4.46,352.0,Bad Fat Black Girl: Notes from a Trap Feminist,1958.0

  The incredible true story of a woman who rode her horse across America in the 1950s, fulfilling her dying wish to see the Pacific Ocean, from the #1 
  
    New York Times
  
   bestselling author of 
  
    The Perfect Horse
  
   and 
  
    The Eighty-Dollar Champion
  
  .
In 1954, Annie Wilkins, a sixty-three-year-old farmer from Maine, embarked on an impossible journey. She had no relatives left, she'd lost her family farm to back taxes, and her doctor had just given her two years to live--but only if she lived restfully. He offered her a spot in the county's charity home. Instead, she decided she wanted to see the Pacific Ocean just once before she died. She bought a cast-off brown gelding named Tarzan, donned men's dungarees, loaded up her horse, and headed out from Maine in mid-November, hoping to beat the snow. She had no map, no GPS, no phone. But she had her ex-racehorse, her faithful mutt, and her own unfailing belief that Americans would treat a stranger with kindness.Between 1954 and 1956, Annie, Tarzan, and her dog, Depeche Toi, journeyed more than 4,000 miles, through America's big cities and small towns, meeting ordinary people and celebrities--from Andrew Wyeth (who sketched Tarzan) to Art Linkletter and Groucho Marx. She received many offers--a permanent home at a riding stable in New Jersey, a job at a gas station in rural Kentucky, even a marriage proposal from a Wyoming rancher who loved animals as much as she did. As Annie trudged through blizzards, forded rivers, climbed mountains, and clung to the narrow shoulder as cars whipped by her at terrifying speeds, she captured the imagination of an apprehensive Cold War America. At a time when small towns were being bypassed by Eisenhower's brand-new interstate highway system, and the reach and impact of television was just beginning to be understood, Annie and her four-footed companions inspired an outpouring of neighborliness in a rapidly changing world.","['History', 'Animals', 'Travel', 'Biography Memoir', 'Horses', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Historical', 'Adventure']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1608626050i/55333765.jpg,0525619321,9780525619321,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55333765-the-ride-of-her-life,336.0,4.24,1593.0,"The Ride of Her Life: The True Story of a Woman, Her Horse, and Their Last-Chance Journey Across America",10000.0

"Elliot Ackerman, James Stavridis",English,"An instant New York Times Bestseller!Consider this another vaccine against disaster. Fortunately, this dose won't cause a temporary feverand it happens to be a rippingly good read.  WiredThis crisply written and well-paced book reads like an all-caps warning for a world shackled to the machines we carry in our pockets and place on our laps . . ."" The Washington PostFrom two former military officers and award-winning authors, a chillingly authentic geopolitical thriller that imagines a naval clash between the US and China in the South China Sea in 2034  and the path from there to a nightmarish global conflagration.On March 12, 2034, US Navy Commodore Sarah Hunt is on the bridge of her flagship, the guided missile destroyer USS John Paul Jones , conducting a routine freedom of navigation patrol in the South China Sea when her ship detects an unflagged trawler in clear distress, smoke billowing from its bridge. On that same day, US Marine aviator Major Chris ""Wedge"" Mitchell is flying an F35E Lightning over the Strait of Hormuz, testing a new stealth technology as he flirts with Iranian airspace. By the end of that day, Wedge will be an Iranian prisoner, and Sarah Hunt's destroyer will lie at the bottom of the sea, sunk by the Chinese Navy. Iran and China have clearly coordinated their moves, which involve the use of powerful new forms of cyber weaponry that render US ships and planes defenseless. In a single day, America's faith in its military's strategic pre-eminence is in tatters. A new, terrifying era is at hand.So begins a disturbingly plausible work of speculative fiction, co-authored by an award-winning novelist and decorated Marine veteran and the former commander of NATO, a legendary admiral who has spent much of his career strategically outmaneuvering America's most tenacious adversaries. Written with a powerful blend of geopolitical sophistication and human empathy, 2034 takes us inside the minds of a global cast of characters--Americans, Chinese, Iranians, Russians, Indians--as a series of arrogant miscalculations on all sides leads the world into an intensifying international storm. In the end, China and the United States will have paid a staggering cost, one that forever alters the global balance of power.Everything in 2034 is an imaginative extrapolation from present-day facts on the ground combined with the authors' years working at the highest and most classified levels of national security. Sometimes it takes a brilliant work of fiction to illuminate the most dire of warnings: 2034 is all too close at hand, and this cautionary tale presents the reader a dark yet possible future that we must do all we can to avoid.","['Novels', 'Politics', 'War', 'China', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Military Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Historical Fiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1593385556i/54211065.jpg,1984881256,9781984881250,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54211065-2034,320.0,3.8,1438.0,2034: A Novel of the Next World War,13277.0

  Set against the backdrop of World War II, Anna, Edmund, and William are evacuated from London to live in the countryside, bouncing from home to home in search of a permanent family.
It is 1940 and Anna, 9, Edmund, 11, and William, 12, have just lost their grandmother. Unfortunately, she left no provision for their guardianship in her will. Her solicitor comes up with a preposterous plan: he will arrange for the children to join a group of schoolchildren who are being evacuated to a village in the country, where they will live with families for the duration of the war. He also hopes that whoever takes the children on might end up willing to adopt them and become their new family--providing, of course, that the children can agree on the choice.Moving from one family to another, the children suffer the cruel trickery of foster brothers, the cold realities of outdoor toilets, and the hollowness of empty tummies. They seek comfort in the village lending library, whose kind librarian, Nora Muller, seems an excellent candidate--except that she has a German husband whose whereabouts are currently unknown. Nevertheless, Nora's cottage is a place of bedtime stories and fireplaces, of vegetable gardens and hot, milky tea. Most important, it's a place where someone thinks they all three hung the moon.

Newly divorced and eager to escape her bleak life in upstate New York, where she moved as an adult, she arrives with her two teenagers to discover a city that has become an unrecognizable ghost town.

Dan Pfeiffer,English,"From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Yes We (Still) Can and cohost of Pod Save America, a sharp political playbook for how Democrats can take on Trump, McConnell, Fox News, and the rest of the right-wing circus dominating American politics.There is nothing more important than beating Donald Trump in 2020, but defeating Trump is just the start of this timely book. Un-Trumping America offers readers three critical insights: first, Trump is not an aberration, but rather the logical extension of the modern Republican Party; second, how Democrats can defeat Trump in 2020; and third, preventing the likes of Trump from ever happening again with a plan to fix democracy.While the catalog of the president's crimes is long and growing, undoing Trumpism -- the political platform of racism, authoritarianism, and plutocracy that gave rise to Trump and defines the Republican Party -- is a long and continuing fight. Through a craven, cynical strategy engineered by Mitch McConnell, funded by the Kochs, and fueled by Fox News propaganda, Republicans have rigged American politics to drown out the voices of the people in favor of the powerful. Without an aggressive response that recognizes who the Republicans are and what they have done, American democracy as we know it won't survive this moment and a conservative, shrinking, mostly white minority will govern the country for decades.Un-Trumping America dismantles toxic Trumpism and offers a way forward. Dan Pfeiffer worked for nearly twenty years at the center of Democratic politics, from the campaign trail to Capitol Hill to Barack Obama's White House. But it was Trump's victory and Republicans' incessant aiding and abetting of Trumpism that has radicalized his thinking. Here, Pfeiffer urges Democrats to embrace bold solutions -- from fixing the courts to abolishing the electoral college to eliminating the filibuster -- in order to make America more democratic (and Democratic).Un-Trumping America is a powerful call for Democrats and progressives to get smarter, tougher, and more aggressive without becoming a paler shade of orange.","['History', 'Politics', 'Government', 'Audiobook', 'Unfinished', 'Memoir', 'American', 'Activism', 'American History', 'Nonfiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1580207547l/51203727.jpg,1538733552,9781538733554,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51203727-un-trumping-america,273.0,4.21,285.0,Un-Trumping America: A Plan to Make America a Democracy Again,2650.0

Matthew Lohmeier,English,"Irresistible Revolution is a timely and bold contribution from an active-duty Space Force lieutenant colonel who sees the impact of a neo-Marxist agenda at the ground level within our armed forces. In it, author Matthew Lohmeier provides answers to many important questions that Americans are currently asking: Is systemic racism a reality, or is much of our talk about race merely a rhetorical tool used to divide Americans? Why has the Defense Department suddenly shifted to a focus on extremism within the ranks? Is there really a white supremacy or white nationalist problem within our armed forces? Are the many Diversity and Inclusion trainings that are being conducted in our federal agencies helping solve these problems, or are they creating conflict where none previously existed? What is Marxism, and what does it have to do with all of this?Though pundits often appear perplexed by current policy decisions being made in our country, our apparent missteps are part of a longstanding plot against America, patiently and methodically pursued by those with a mind intent on the overthrow of the US Government and its replacement with a communist dictatorship. Unfortunately, many of those now furthering that agenda do so unwittingly.After becoming aware of the Marxist conquest of American society, you will never again look at things in the same way. Mainstream media, social media, the public education system (including universities), as well as federal agencies have all become vessels of various schools of thought that are rooted in Marxist ideology - an ideology bent on the destruction of America's history, of Western tradition, specifically Judeo-Christian values, and of patriotism and conservatism. Marxism's sinister and dark agenda has led the country into what some have called a cold civil war. The problem has become systemic, a tragedy considering that the defeat of Marxist-communist ideology was the very cause against which our nation spent great treasures of blood and iron during much of the twentieth century.The book's three-part framework begins with a discussion of the greatness of the American ideal (including the importance of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the notions of individual and civil liberties), transitions to an examination of the history and overarching narrative of Marxist ideology (specifically Marx's and Engels' Communist Manifesto wherein the oppressor vs. oppressed narrative is developed), and concludes by looking into the ongoing transformation of America's military culture and military policy, while also providing a warning about where the country is headed if we choose to not make an immediate course correction.Irresistible Revolution also covers a breadth of hot topics everyone is hearing and talking about - topics that actually have implications for our national security: woke ideology, cancel culture, identity politics, the Black Lives Matter movement, anti-racism, postmodernism, political correctness, and critical and cynical theories, to include critical race theory. Lohmeier's penetrating and common sense look at current events within our military and across American society is a sublimely unique contribution that is certain to be shared, referenced, and discussed for years to come. Every American, including every US military servicemember, needs to read and understand the Irresistible Revolution.","['History', 'Cultural', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Military Fiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1621202550i/58062110.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58062110-irresistible-revolution,211.0,4.58,82.0,Irresistible Revolution: Marxism's Goal of Conquest & the Unmaking of the American Military,492.0

Robert  L.  Woodson Sr.,English,"An indispensable corrective to the falsified version of black history presented by The 1619 Project, radical activists, and money-hungry diversity consultants.In the rush to redefine the place of black Americans in contemporary society, many radical activists and academics have mounted a campaign to destroy traditional American history and replace it with a politicized version that few would recognize. According to the new radical orthodoxy, the United States was founded as a racist nationand everything that has happened throughout our history must be viewed through the lens of the systemic oppression of black people. Rejecting this false narrative, a collection of the most prominent and respected black scholars and thinkers has come together to correct the record and tell the true story of black Americans in all its complexity, diversity of experience, and poignancy. Collectively, they paint a vivid picture of black people living the grand American experience, however bumpy the road may be along the way. But rather than a people apart, blacks are woven into the united whole that makes this nation unique in history.Featuring Essays John Sibley ButlerJason D.

Biao  Wang,English,"Biao Wang's memoir 'JOURNEY TO THE WEST' is a fascinating account of the passage of a poor boy from a small, impoverished rural Chinese village to a brilliant, international commercial career and will read as a truly inspiring example of what can be achieved from the least promising background through determination and imagination. A potted history of modern China leads seamlessly into the story of a young man who, with a combination of remarkable foresight, dedication and courage, has built several successful businesses and established himself at a remarkably young age as a leader in international commercial co-operation.  Here is somebody who has grasped life eagerly, and what his buoyant tale demonstrates is the importance of seeing opportunity and unhesitatingly pursuing it; the story bursts with energy and practical wisdom without any sense of self-importance, whilst taking us stage by stage through Biao's interesting life. From his relatively carefree, if impoverished, childhood in a small village, he takes us, unhurriedly through his education and early struggles, to his great leap forward when he bravely sets out for the unknown world of England, determined to immerse himself in its culture rather than retreating into the comfortable familiarity of his compatriots, seizing opportunities as they arise, always aware of his place in the wider scheme of things. The narrative offers an intriguing picture of life in contemporary China, and on the way explains much about the Chinese character and attitudes. His insights into what makes for success are almost incidental as we follow his journey from grinding poverty to commercial achievement. Those from similar backgrounds in any part of the world can take courage from this eloquent account of the power of determination; readers anywhere can share in his infectious enthusiasm for life and all the opportunities it offers. JOURNEY TO THE WEST is also a timely reminder, at a time when the emerging power of China is seen as a threat to the West, that we are all one species, with the same needs and desires, as through his storytelling Biao Wang gives China and the Chinese a human face.  JOURNEY TO THE WEST is a cultural bridge as well as a thoroughly enjoyable and absorbing read. As Biao Wang most eloquently says having travelled the world and witnessed many inequalities and the problems such different starting blocks can bring, if Ive learned anything, it is that success is always possible, whatever your situation and however your life begins.  So, fasten your seat belts and take note as you travel from one extraordinary chapter to another  it should be an inspiration to us all.","['China', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Memoir']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1608804980i/56397497.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56397497-journey-to-the-west,256.0,4.28,36.0,Journey to the West: A Long March from Eastern Dream to Western Reality,136.0

Ross Douthat,English,"NEW YORK TIMES EDITORS CHOICE  In this vulnerable, insightful memoir, the New York Times columnist tells the story of his five-year struggle with a disease that officially doesnt exist, exploring the limits of modern medicine, the stories that we unexpectedly fall into, and the secrets that only suffering reveals.A powerful memoir about our fragile hopes in the face of chronic illness.Kate Bowler, bestselling author of Everything Happens for a ReasonIn the summer of 2015, Ross Douthat was moving his family, with two young daughters and a pregnant wife, from Washington, D.C., to a sprawling farmhouse in a picturesque Connecticut town when he acquired a mysterious and devastating sickness. It left him sleepless, crippled, wracked with pain--a shell of himself. After months of seeing doctors and descending deeper into a physical inferno, he discovered that he had a disease which according to CDC definitions does not actually exist: the chronic form of Lyme disease, a hotly contested condition that devastates the lives of tens of thousands of people but has no official recognition--and no medically approved cure.From a rural dream house that now felt like a prison, Douthat's search for help takes him off the map of official medicine, into territory where cranks and conspiracies abound and patients are forced to take control of their own treatment and experiment on themselves. Slowly, against his instincts and assumptions, he realizes that many of the cranks and weirdos are right, that many supposed ""hypochondriacs"" are victims of an indifferent medical establishment, and that all kinds of unexpected experiences and revelations lurk beneath the surface of normal existence, in the places underneath.TheDeep Places is a story about what happens when you are terribly sick and realize that even the doctors who are willing to treat you can only do so much. Along the way, Douthat describes his struggle back toward health with wit and candor, portraying sickness as the most terrible of gifts. It teaches you to appreciate the grace of ordinary life by taking that life away from you. It reveals the deep strangeness of the world, the possibility that the reasonable people might be wrong, and the necessity of figuring out things for yourself.

These collected short stories--most of them originally published in magazines including Esquire and The Saturday Evening Post in the 1960s and 1970s, along with a new story that brings her early characters into the present--are evocative of an era that still resonates deeply today.In the title story, a bystander tries to soothe a woman who seems to have cracked under the pressures of motherhood. And in several linked stories throughout, the relationship between the narrator and her husband unfolds in telling and often hilarious vignettes. Of their time and yet timeless, Wolitzer's stories zero in on the domestic sphere and ordinary life with wit, candor, grace, and an acutely observant eye. Brilliantly capturing the tensions and contradictions of daily life, Today a Woman Went Mad in the Supermarket is full of heart and insight, providing a lens into a world that was often unseen at the time, and often overlooked now--reintroducing a beloved writer to be embraced by a whole new generation of readers.","['Short Story Collection', 'Short Stories', 'Audiobook', 'Humor', 'Literary Fiction', 'Anthologies', 'Adult Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Fiction', 'Adult']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1608629404i/55891837.jpg,1635577624,9781635577624,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55891837-today-a-woman-went-mad-in-the-supermarket,208.0,3.76,571.0,Today a Woman Went Mad in the Supermarket: Stories,3726.0

Evan Osnos,English,"A FINANCIAL TIMES BEST BOOK OF 2020A concise, brilliant, and trenchant examination of Joseph R. Biden Jr.s successful lifelong quest for the presidency by National Book Award winner Evan Osnos.President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been called both the luckiest man and the unluckiestfortunate to have sustained a fifty-year political career that reached the White House, but also marked by deep personal losses and disappointments that he has suffered.Yet even as Bidens life has been shaped by drama, it has also been powered by a willingness, rare at the top ranks of politics, to confront his shortcomings, errors, and reversals of fortune. As he says, Failure at some point in your life is inevitable, but giving up is unforgivable. His trials have forged in him a deep empathy for others in hardshipan essential quality as he leads America toward recovery and renewal.Blending up-close journalism and broader context, Evan Osnos, who won the National Book Award in 2014, draws on nearly a decade of reporting for The New Yorker to capture the characters and meaning of 2020s extraordinary presidential election. It is based on lengthy interviews with Biden and on revealing conversations with more than a hundred others, including President Barack Obama, Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, and a range of activists, advisers, opponents, and Biden family members.This portrayal illuminates Bidens long and eventful career in the Senate, his eight years as Obamas vice president, his sojourn in the political wilderness after being passed over for Hillary Clinton in 2016, his decision to challenge Donald Trump for the presidency, and his choice of Vice President Kamala Harris as his running mate.Osnos ponders the difficulties Biden faces as his presidency begins and weighs how a changing country, a deep well of experiences, and a rigorous approach to the issues, have altered his positions. In this nuanced portrait, Biden emerges as flawed, yet resolute, and tempered by the flame of tragedya man who just may be uncannily suited for his moment in history.","['History', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Us Presidents', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir', 'Presidents', 'Biography', 'American History', 'Nonfiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1601820685i/55246908.jpg,1982174021,9781982174026,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55246908-joe-biden,172.0,3.71,468.0,"Joe Biden: The Life, the Run, and What Matters Now",3211.0

But when their idealism sparks revolution in France and the guillotine threatens everything she holds dear, Adrienne must choose to renounce the complicated man she loves, or risk her life for a legacy that will inspire generations to come.A daring visionary...1914. Glittering New York socialite Beatrice Astor Chanler is a force of nature, daunted by nothing--not her humble beginnings, her crumbling marriage, or the outbreak of war. But after witnessing the devastation in France and delivering war-relief over dangerous seas, Beatrice takes on the challenge of a lifetime: convincing America to fight for what's right.A reluctant resistor...1940. French school-teacher and aspiring artist Marthe Simone has an orphan's self-reliance and wants nothing to do with war.

Sam Neill,English,"In this unexpected memoir, written in a creative burst of just a few months in 2022, Sam Neill tells the story of how he became one of the worlds most celebrated actors, who has worked with everyone from Meryl Streep to Isabel Adjani, from Jeff Goldblum to Sean Connery, from Steven Spielberg to Jane Campion.By his own account, his career has been a series of unpredictable turns of fortune. Born in 1947 in Northern Ireland, he emigrated to New Zealand at the age of seven. His family settled in Dunedin on the South Island, but young Sam was sent away to boarding school in Christchurch, where he was hopeless at sports and discovered he enjoyed acting.But how did you become an actor in New Zealand in the 1960 and 1970s where there was no film industry? After university he made documentary films while also appearing in occasional amateur productions of Shakespeare. In 1977 he took the lead in Sleeping Dogs, the first feature made in New Zealand in more than a decade, a project that led to a major role in Gillian Armstrongs celebrated My Brilliant Career.And after that Sam Neill found his way, sometimes by accident, into his own brilliant career. He has worked around the world, an actor who has moved effortlessly from blockbuster to art house to TV, from Dr Alan Grant in the Jurassic Park movies to The Piano and Peaky Blinders.Did I Ever Tell You This? is a joy to read, a marvellous and often very funny book, the work of a natural storyteller who is a superb observer of other people, and who writes with love and warmth about his family. It is also his account of his life outside film, especially in Central Otago where he established Two Paddocks, his vineyard famous for its pinot noir.","['Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir', 'Humor', 'Film', 'Biography', 'Australia', 'Nonfiction', 'Autobiography', 'Adult']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1667862848i/63251402.jpg,1922790303,9781922790309,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63251402-did-i-ever-tell-you-this,398.0,4.08,490.0,Did I Ever Tell You This?,4152.0

Jensen--you just never knew it. As the owner of the world's largest disaster management company, he has spent most of his adult life responding to tragedy. From the Oklahoma City bombing, 9/11, the Bali bombings, the 2004 South Asian Tsunami, Hurricane Katrina to the 2010 Haitian Earthquake and the Grenfell Tower Fire, Jensen is at the practical level of international incidents, assisting with the recovery of bodies, identifying victims, and repatriating and returning their personal effects to the surviving family members. He is also, crucially, involved in the emotional recovery that comes after a disaster: helping guide the families, governments, and companies involved, telling them what to expect and managing the unmanageable. As he puts it, ""If journalists write the first rough draft of history, I put the punctuation on the past.""Personal Effects is an unsparing, up-close look at the difficult work Jensen does behind the yellow tape and the lessons he learned there. The chronicle of an almost impossible and grim job, Personal Effects also tells Jensen's own story, how he came to this line of work, how he manages the chaos that is his life, and the personal toll the repeated exposure to mass death brings, in becoming what GQ called ""the best at the worst job in the world.""A rare glimpse into a world we all see but many know nothing about, Personal Effects is an inspiring and heartwarming story of survival and the importance of moving forward. Jensen allows his readers to see over his shoulder as he responds to disaster sites, uncovers the deceased, and cares for families to show how a strong will and desire to do good can become a path through the worst the world can throw at us.","['History', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Death', 'True Crime', 'Nonfiction', 'Autobiography', 'Adult']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1625602718i/53137995.jpg,1250267994,9781250267993,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53137995-personal-effects,304.0,3.82,295.0,Personal Effects: What Recovering the Dead Teaches Me About Caring for the Living,1294.0
David Wright Falad,English,"Already excerpted in the New Yorker , Black Cloud Rising is a compelling and important historical novel that takes us back to an extraordinary moment when enslaved men and women were shedding their bonds and embracing freedom By fall of 1863, Union forces had taken control of Tidewater Virginia, and established a toehold in eastern North Carolina, including along the Outer Banks. Thousands of freed slaves and runaways flooded the Union lines, but Confederate irregulars still roamed the region. In December, the newly formed African Brigade, a unit of these former slaves led by General Edward Augustus Wilda one-armed, impassioned Abolitionistset out from Portsmouth to hunt down the rebel guerillas and extinguish the threat.From this little-known historical episode comes Black Cloud Rising , a dramatic, moving account of these soldiersmen who only weeks earlier had been enslaved, but were now Union infantrymen setting out to fight their former owners. At the heart of the narrative is Sergeant Richard Etheridge, the son of a slave and her master, raised with some privileges but constantly reminded of his place. Deeply conflicted about his past, Richard is eager to show himself to be a credit to his race. As the African Brigade conducts raids through the areas occupied by the Confederate Partisan Rangers, he and his comrades recognize that they are fighting for more than territory. Wilds mission is to prove that his troops can be trusted as soldiers in combat. And because many of the men have fled from the very plantations in their path, each raid is also an opportunity to free loved ones left behind. For Richard, this means the possibility of reuniting with Fanny, the woman he hopes to marry one day.With powerful depictions of the bonds formed between fighting men and heartrending scenes of sacrifice and courage, Black Cloud Rising offers a compelling and nuanced portrait of enslaved men and women crossing the threshold to freedom.","['Adult', 'Audiobook', 'War', 'Social Justice', 'Literary Fiction', 'Civil War', 'Race', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1642894333i/60185269.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60185269-black-cloud-rising,293.0,3.79,194.0,Black Cloud Rising,1071.0

So pervasive are human impacts on the planet that its said we live in a new geological epoch: the Anthropocene.

One way to look at human civilization, says Kolbert, is as a ten-thousand-year exercise in defying nature. In The Sixth Extinction, she explored the ways in which our capacity for destruction has reshaped the natural world. Now she examines how the very sorts of interventions that have imperiled our planet are increasingly seen as the only hope for its salvation.

Morgan Housel,English,"Doing well with money isn't necessarily about what you know. It's about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. Money--investing, personal finance, and business decisions--is typically taught as a math-based field, where data and formulas tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world people don't make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together. In The Psychology of Money, award-winning author Morgan Housel shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life's most important topics.","['Personal Finance', 'Self Help', 'Audiobook', 'Psychology', 'Nonfiction', 'Personal Development', 'Money', 'Economics', 'Business', 'Finance']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1581527774i/41881472.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41881472-the-psychology-of-money,252.0,4.33,12812.0,The Psychology of Money,178848.0
Isabel Allende,English,"
  From the 
  
    New York Times
  
   bestselling author of 
  
    A Long Petal of the Sea
  
   comes a passionate and inspiring meditation on what it means to be a woman. 
""When I say that I was a feminist in kindergarten, I am not exaggerating,"" begins Isabel Allende. As a child, she watched her mother, abandoned by her husband, provide for her three small children without ""resources or voice."" Isabel became a fierce and defiant little girl, determined to fight for the life her mother couldn't have.As a young woman coming of age in the late 1960s, she rode the first wave of feminism. Among a tribe of like-minded female journalists, she for the first time felt comfortable in her own skin, as they wrote ""with a knife between their teeth"" about women's issues. She has seen what has been accomplished by the movement in the course of her lifetime. And over the course of three passionate marriages, she has learned how to grow as a woman while having a partner, when to step away, and the rewards of embracing one's sexuality.So what do women want? To be safe, to be valued, to live in peace, to have their own resources, to be connected, to have control over their bodies and lives, and above all, to be loved. On all these fronts, there is much work to be done, and this book, Allende hopes, will ""light the torch of our daughters and granddaughters with mine. They will have to live for us, as we lived for our mothers, and carry on with the work still left to be finished.""","['History', 'Womens', 'Audiobook', 'Essays', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir', 'Feminism', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Autobiography']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1607320425i/54075385.jpg,0593355628,9780593355626,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54075385-the-soul-of-a-woman,174.0,4.04,3093.0,The Soul of a Woman,27384.0

Cathleen Schine,English,"The beloved bestselling author of The Three Weissmanns of Westportonce dubbed the modern-day Jewish Jane Austenbrings forth a comedy of generational manners that glides between 1939 and 2020 L.A. as Mamie Knstler and her grandson weather hard times and discover how to make them their own.Julian Knstler comes from New York City to L.A. like many a lost twenty-something: to find a job writing in the entertainment industry. But this is 2020 and his temporary visit turns into an extended stay, trapped by the lockdown in a little house in Venice with his glamorous, eccentric, and ancient grandmother. Ninety-three-years old, Mamie came to Los Angeles from Vienna at eleven with her parents in 1939 among a wave of Jewish musicians, directors, and intellectuals escaping Hitler. As the months roll on, she begins to tell Julian her stories of the eminent emigres shes known and the magical world they inhabited as their old world was destroyedpeople like Arnold Schoenberg, Christopher Isherwood, and Greta Garbo. Not quite all her stories, however. The pandemic isolates Julian from his world, but from Mamie he learns of the world that came before him and how much the past holds of the future. A tender, sharply wrought comic novel about exile, the power of stories handed down and handed on, and the power of stories held secretly in the heart.Cathleen Schines writing has been hailed as sparkling, crisp, clever, deft, hilarious and deeply affecting by the New York Times, and those qualities stand out more than ever in Knstlers in Paradise. Here, Schine weaves together the story of a family of Jewish migrs just after they fled from Vienna to LA in the 1930s and life in the pandemic to craft a beautiful, often humorous examination of the identities we inherit and assume and what it means to be displaced. Knstlers in Paradise is the coming-of-age story of a indecisive young man coming into his own and his eccentric, worldly grandmother as they both discover that history does not end.","['Jewish', 'Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Literary Fiction', 'Judaism', 'Family', 'Contemporary', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1659548305i/60784564.jpg,1250805902,9781250805904,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60784564-k-nstlers-in-paradise,272.0,3.55,489.0,Künstlers in Paradise,2880.0
Candace Owens,English,"Political activist and social media star Candace Owens explains all the reasons how the Democratic Party policies hurt, rather than help, the African American community, and why she and many others are turning right. What do you have to lose? This question, posed by then-presidential candidate Donald Trump to potential black voters, was mocked and dismissed by the mainstream media. But for Candace Owens and many others, it was a wake-up call. A staunch Democrat for all of her life, she began to question the lefts policies toward black Americans, and investigate the harm they inflict on the community. In Blackout, social media star and conservative commentator Owens addresses the many ways that liberal policies and ideals are actually harmful to African Americans and hinder their ability to rise above poverty, live independent and successful lives, and be an active part of the American Dream. Weaving in her personal story that brought her from the projects to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, she demonstrates how she overcame her setbacks and challenges despite the cultural expectation that she should embrace a victim mentality. Owens argues that government assistance is a double-edged sword, that the left dismisses the faith so important to the black community, that Democratic permissiveness toward abortion disproportionately affects the black babies, that the #MeToo movement hurts black men, and much more. Well-researched and intelligently argued, Blackout lays bare the myth that all black people should vote Democratand shows why turning to the right will leave them happier, more successful, and more self-sufficient.","['History', 'Politics', 'Cultural', 'Audiobook', 'Memoir', 'Race', 'Sociology', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Adult']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1564941528i/50930292.jpg,1982133295,9781982133290,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50930292-blackout,240.0,4.42,2059.0,Blackout: How Black America Can Make Its Second Escape from the Democrat Plantation,13763.0

Stacey Abrams,English,"
  #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER - A gripping, complexly plotted thriller set within the halls of the U.S. Supreme Court, where a young law clerk finds herself embroiled in a shocking mystery crafted by one of the most preeminent judges in America--from celebrated national leader and bestselling author Stacey Abrams.
""Abrams follows in Dan Brown's footprint with this masterfully plotted thriller that unfolds like the ultimate chess match--bold move to bolder move with lives hanging in the balance.""--Lisa Gardner, author of Before She Disappeared ""A first-class legal thriller, favorably compared to many of the best, starting with The Pelican Brief,  which it brings to mind. It's fast-paced and full of surprises--a terrific read.""--Scott Turow, author of Presumed InnocentAvery Keene, a brilliant young law clerk for the legendary Justice Howard Wynn, is doing her best to hold her life together--excelling in an arduous job with the court while also dealing with a troubled family. When the shocking news breaks that Justice Wynn--the cantankerous swing vote on many current high-profile cases--has slipped into a coma, Avery's life turns upside down. She is immediately notified that Justice Wynn has left instructions for her to serve as his legal guardian and power of attorney. Plunged into an explosive role she never anticipated, Avery finds that Justice Wynn had been secretly researching one of the most controversial cases before the court--a proposed merger between an American biotech company and an Indian genetics firm, which promises to unleash breathtaking results in the medical field. She also discovers that Wynn suspected a dangerously related conspiracy that infiltrates the highest power corridors of Washington.As political wrangling ensues in Washington to potentially replace the ailing judge whose life and survival Avery controls, she begins to unravel a carefully constructed, chesslike sequence of clues left behind by Wynn. She comes to see that Wynn had a much more personal stake in the controversial case and realizes his complex puzzle will lead her directly into harm's way in order to find the truth. While Justice Sleeps is a cunningly crafted, sophisticated novel, layered with myriad twists and a vibrant cast of characters. Drawing on her astute inside knowledge of the court and political landscape, Stacey Abrams shows herself to be not only a force for good in politics and voter fairness but also a major new talent in suspense fiction.","['Adult', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Legal Thriller', 'Contemporary', 'Fiction', 'Thriller']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1610386381i/55671327.jpg,0385546572,9780385546577,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55671327-while-justice-sleeps,367.0,3.96,4831.0,While Justice Sleeps,40671.0

Edmund  Richardson,English,"For centuries the city of Alexandria Beneath the Mountains was a meeting point of East and West. Then it vanished. In 1833 it was discovered in Afghanistan by the unlikeliest person imaginable: Charles Masson, deserter, traveller, pilgrim, doctor, archaeologist, spy, and eventually one of the most respected scholars in Asia, and the greatest of nineteenth-century travellers. On the way into one of history's most extraordinary stories, he would take tea with kings, travel with holy men and become the master of a hundred disguises; he would see things no westerner had glimpsed before and few have glimpsed since. He would spy for the East India Company and be suspected of spying for Russia at the same time, for this was the era of the Great Game, when imperial powers confronted each other in these staggeringly beautiful lands. Masson discovered tens of thousands of pieces of Afghan history, including the 2,000 year old Bimaran golden casket, which has upon it the earliest known face of the Buddha. He would be offered his own kingdom; he would change the world, and the world would destroy him.This is a wild journey through nineteenth-century India and Afghanistan, with impeccably researched storytelling that shows us a world of espionage and dreamers, ne'er-do-wells and opportunists, extreme violence both personal and military, and boundless hope. At the edge of empire, amid the deserts and the mountains, it is the story of an obsession passed down the centuries.","['History', 'Travel', 'Audiobook', 'World History', 'Archaeology', 'Asia', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Historical', 'Adventure']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1612197698i/55657746.jpg,1526603810,9781526603814,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55657746-alexandria,304.0,3.8,198.0,Alexandria: The Quest for the Lost City,845.0

Unknown SoldierSet in the South at the height of the Vietnam War, The Unwilling combines crime, suspense and searing glimpses into the human mind and soul in New York Times bestselling author John Hart's singular style. Gibby's older brothers have already been to war. One died there. The other came back misunderstood and hard, a decorated killer now freshly released from a three-year stint in prison. Jason won't speak of the war or of his time behind bars, but he wants a relationship with the younger brother he hasn't known for years. Determined to make that connection, he coaxes Gibby into a day at the long hours of sunshine and whisky and older women. But the day turns ugly when the four encounter a prison transfer bus on a stretch of empty road. Beautiful but drunk, one of the women taunts the prisoners, leading to a riot on the bus. The woman finds it funny in the moment, but is savagely murdered soon after. Given his violent history, suspicion turns first to Jason; but when the second woman is kidnapped, the police suspect Gibby, too. Determined to prove Jason innocent, Gibby must avoid the cops and dive deep into his brother's hidden life, a dark world of heroin, guns and outlaw motorcycle gangs. What he discovers there is a truth more disturbing than he could have not just the identity of the killer and the reasons for Tyra's murder, but the forces that shaped his brother in Vietnam, the reason he was framed, and why the most dangerous man alive wants him back in prison.

John Kampfner,English,"A provocative and entertaining exploration of the country that Britons love to hate by one of our most respected journalists.Emerging from a collection of disparate city states 150 years ago, no other country has had as turbulent a history as Germany or enjoyed so much prosperity in such a short time frame. Today, as much of the world succumbs to authoritarianism and democracy is undermined from its heart, Germany stands as a bulwark for decency and stability.Mixing personal journey and anecdote with compelling empirical evidence, this is a searching and entertaining exploration of the country many in the West still love to hate. Raising important questions for our post-Brexit landscape, Kampfner asks why Germany has become a model for others to emulate, while Britain still languishes in wartime nostalgia and fails to tackle contemporary challenges. Part memoir, part history, part travelogue, Why the Germans Do It Better is a rich and witty portrait of an eternally fascinating country.","['History', 'Politics', 'Cultural', 'Travel', 'Germany', 'Economics', 'Sociology', 'Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Society']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1594975121i/54443313.jpg,1786499754,9781786499752,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54443313-why-the-germans-do-it-better,320.0,3.97,356.0,Why the Germans Do it Better: Notes from a Grown-Up Country,3126.0

Marjorie Garber,English,"This panoramic look at the concept of character reveals cultural shifts, unexploded fallacies, and more than a little bad behavior, rhetorical and otherwise. What does it mean to have character or to say that one has character issues? To what extent are character traits or character types fixed or mutable, innate or conditioned, essential or enacted? What about the character of a nation or a group of people? Surveying philosophical, literary, and social science perspectives as well as recent political rhetoric, the author finds that character is a bewilderingly slippery abstraction that has endured and evolved. Once an assertion of ethical substance and personal virtue, more recent usage implies that character is something to be performed, not built. Too often, it is defined by its absence, as in actions deemed out of character or when someone's character is praised despite despicable actions. The author wonders if the concept is so hollowed out by misuse that it should be retired, but in the end, she views character as a mirror reflecting the contradictions","['History', 'Cultural', 'Literary Criticism', 'Psychology', 'Language', 'Sociology', 'American', 'Philosophy', 'Anthropology', 'Nonfiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1573872670l/51542153.jpg,0374120854,9780374120856,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51542153-character,464.0,3.03,7.0,Character: The History of a Cultural Obsession,29.0

Victoria Chang,English,"After her mother died, poet Victoria Chang refused to write elegies. Rather, she distilled her grief during a feverish two weeks by writing scores of poetic obituaries for all she lost in the world. In Obit, Chang writes of ""the way memory gets up after someone has died and starts walking."" These poems reinvent the form of newspaper obituary to both name what has died (""civility,"" ""language,"" ""the future,"" ""Mother's blue dress"") and the cultural impact of death on the living. Whereas elegy attempts to immortalize the dead, an obituary expresses loss, and the love for the dead becomes a conduit for self-expression. In this unflinching and lyrical book, Chang meets her grief and creates a powerful testament for the living.","['Asian Literature', 'Memoir', 'American', 'Biography', 'Contemporary', 'Death', 'Poetry', 'Nonfiction', 'Female Authors', 'Adult']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1585173082l/53029244.jpg,1556595743,9781556595745,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53029244-obit,113.0,4.27,624.0,Obit,3540.0

Mark Synnott,English,"Veteran climber Mark Synnott never planned on climbing Mount Everest, but a hundred-year mystery lured him into an expedition--and an awesome history of passionate adventure, chilling tragedy, and human aspiration unfolded.On June 8, 1924, George Mallory and ""Sandy"" Irvine set out to stand on the roof of the world, where no one had stood before. They were last seen eight hundred feet shy of Everest's summit. A century later, we still don't know whether they achieved their goal, decades before Sir Edmund Hillary and Tensing Norgay did, in 1953. Irvine carried a Kodak camera with him to record their attempt, but it, along with his body, had never been found. Did Mallory and Irvine reach the summit and take a photograph before they fell to their deaths?Mark Synnott made his own ascent up the infamous North Face along with a filmmaker using drone technology higher than any had previously flown. His goal: to find Irvine's body and the camera he carried that might have held a summit photo on its still-viable film. Synnott's quest led him from oxygen-deprivation training to archives and museums in England, to Kathmandu, the Tibetan High Plateau, and up the North Face into a storm during a season described as the one that broke Everest. An awful traffic jam of climbers at the very summit resulted in tragic deaths. Sherpas revolted. Chinese government agents turned adversarial. An Indian woman crawled her way to safety and survival. Synnott himself went off the safety rope--if he had slipped, no one would have been able to save him--desperate to solve the mystery.A magnificent story a la The Lost City of Z, The Third Pole conveys the miracle of a mountain the world wants to own, and the first explorers who may have done so.","['History', 'Sports', 'Travel', 'Audiobook', 'Memoir', 'Climbing', 'Biography', 'Mountaineering', 'Nonfiction', 'Adventure']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1636159783i/59525603.jpg,1472273702,9781472273703,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59525603-the-third-pole,448.0,4.15,426.0,The Third Pole: My Everest climb to find the truth about Mallory and Irvine,3472.0

Louann Brizendine,English,"The New York Times bestselling author of The Female Brain explains how a woman's brain changes for the better in midlife, reframing the patriarchal term menopause and inspiring women to unlock their full potential.When Louann Brizendine published The Female Brain, it was a game-changer for its profound scientific understanding of how women think, communicate, and feel. Now, Brizendine uses her unique ability of making science approachable to offer an empowering vision of the years in a woman's life that have too often been ignored or misunderstood and creates a positive new framework for this life stage. She never uses the words perimenopause or menopause, with their suggestions of obsolescence. She guides women to become more of who they are and who they want to be in the second half of life.After analyzing the latest research, Brizendine has found that in midlife the inclination to cater to the needs of others relaxes, allowing women to become more centered while retaining their gifts of perception. The change in ratio of estrogen to testosterone makes women more direct and able to speak out. There's also a drop in anxiety that allows the female brain to flip its attentional style from multitasking to focusing on one thing at a time. The upgraded female brain is centered, direct, validated, focused, fearless, expansive, and free. In this sweeping look at the second half of life, Brizendine dives deep into the microscopic workings of your mitochondria one moment and zooms out to the bigger picture--family, relationships, identity--the next. With clear prescriptive advice, she also offers specific ways women can fend off dementia; increase longevity, well-being, and sexuality; and find their best selves at this stage of life. Ultimately, The Upgrade amounts to a celebration of how women step into their power and an entirely new--and radically positive--understanding of aging.","['Womens', 'Self Help', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Feminism', 'Health', 'Brain', 'Nonfiction', 'Mental Health', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1636346171i/46064088.jpg,0525577173,9780525577171,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46064088-the-upgrade,336.0,3.88,84.0,The Upgrade: How the Female Brain Gets Stronger and Better in Midlife and Beyond,387.0

As the order of her world begins to shatter, Wren must uncover the truth of her father's mysterious legend and her mother's harrowing history and complex bond with her best friend.

M. William Phelps,English,"New York Times bestselling author, television personality, and host of the #1 podcast ""Paper Ghosts,"" M. William Phelps is one of America's most celebrated true crime authorities. In WE THOUGHT WE KNEW YOU, he takes readers deep into the murder of Mary Yoder, a popular wife, mother, and healer in Upstate New York -- telling a gripping tale of a family drama, a determined investigation, and a killer with the face of an angel.In July 2015, Mary Yoder returned home from the chiropractic center that she operated with her husband, Bill, complaining that she felt unwell. Mary, health-conscious and vibrant, was suddenly vomiting, sweating, and weak. Doctors in the ER and ICU were baffled as to the cause of her rapidly progressing illness. Her loved ones--including Bill and their children, Adam, Tamryn, and Liana--gathered in shock to say goodbye.In the weeks that followed Mary's death, the grief-stricken family received startling news from the medical examiner: Mary had been deliberately poisoned. The lethal substance was colchicine, a chemical used to treat gout but extremely toxic if not taken as prescribed. Mary did not have gout. Another bombshell followed when the local sheriff's office received a claim that Adam Yoder had poisoned his mother. But Adam was not the only person of interest in the case. Pretty and popular Kaitlyn Conley, Adam's ex-girlfriend, worked at the Yoders' clinic. She'd even been at Mary's bedside during those last terrible hours. Still, some spoke of her talent for manipulation and a history of bizarre, rage-fueled behavior against anyone who dared to reject her. Had Kaitlyn and Adam conspired to kill Mary Yoder, or was the killer someone else entirely?In another twist, accusations were hurled at Bill Yoder himself, ricocheting blame in still another direction...Renowned investigative journalist M. William Phelps details this incredible story piece by piece, revealing a heartless plan of revenge--a scheme that would tear a family apart, divide a community, and result in two gripping, high-profile trials.","['Crime', 'Adult', 'Audiobook', 'True Story', 'Mystery', 'Biography', 'True Crime', 'Nonfiction', 'Thriller']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1602568106i/53239913.jpg,1496728815,9781496728814,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53239913-we-thought-we-knew-you,336.0,4.12,321.0,"We Thought We Knew You: A Terrifying True Story of Secrets, Betrayal, Deception, and Murder",2711.0

Some historians believe the mysterious illness and violent hallucinations were caused by spoiled bread; others claim it was the result of covert government testing on the local population.

Lola Olufemi,English,"More than just a slogan on a t-shirt, feminism is a radical tool for fighting back against structural violence and injustice. Feminism, Interrupted is a bold call to seize feminism back from the cultural gatekeepers and return it to its radical roots. Lola Olufemi explores state violence against women, the fight for reproductive justice, transmisogyny, gendered Islamophobia and solidarity with global struggles, showing that the fight for gendered liberation can change the world for everybody when we refuse to think of it solely as women's work. Including testimonials from Sisters Uncut, migrant groups working for reproductive justice, prison abolitionists and activists involved in the international fight for Kurdish and Palestinian rights, Olufemi emphasises the link between feminism and grassroots organising. Reclaiming feminism from the clutches of the consumerist, neoliberal model, Feminism, Interrupted shows that when 'feminist' is more than a label, it holds the potential for radical transformative work.","['Gender', 'Womens', 'Politics', 'Theory', 'Essays', 'Social Justice', 'Race', 'Feminism', 'Sociology', 'Nonfiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1576152520i/48856308.jpg,0745340067,9780745340067,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48856308-feminism-interrupted,148.0,4.45,385.0,"Feminism, Interrupted: Disrupting Power",2873.0

"John Solomon, Seamus Bruner",English,"""This book is a MUST BUY!"" President Donald J. Trump ""The Russia andUkraine scandals are unraveled, corruption andgreed exposed. No one is better at uncovering the truth than these two investigative journalists.""  Gregg Jarrett, FOX News legal analyst and author of the #1NYTbestsellersThe Russia HoaxandWitch Hunt An exhaustively researched book that reads like an investigative thriller, Fallout revealshow Obamas Russian Reset led to corruption, scandal, and a desperate bid to impeach Donald Trump.In 2015, a major story broke exposing Hillary Clintons role in approving the sale of American uranium assets to the Russian state nuclear agency, Rosatom. Not only did the sale of Uranium One put 20 percent of Americas domestic uranium supply under the control of Vladimir Putin, there was also evidence that the Clintons themselves had hugely profited from the deal. When presidential candidate Donald Trump made Uranium One the centerpiece of his Crooked Hillary attacks, the Clinton team feared its potential to damage Hillarys campaign. Others in the Obama-Biden camp worried that if elected, Trump would expose their role in selling out Americas security to Putin. Their desperate need to neutralize the issue led them to launch an unprecedented investigation into the Trump campaigns purported ties to Russia. The infamous Steele dossier, produced by Clinton-connected Fusion GPS, sparked an investigation under FBI Director James Comey. Instead of ending after the election, the investigation grew bigger, eventually leading to Comeys firing and the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. When Mueller failed to find grounds for impeachment, Democrats seized on an ambiguous phone call with the Ukrainian president as a pretext to remove Trump from office. This gambit blew up in their faces when it exposed the secrets that Democrats tried hard to keep buried. An indispensable guide to the hidden background of recent events, Fallout shows how Putins bid for nuclear dominance produced a series of political scandals that ultimately posed one of the greatest threats to our democracy in modern American history.","['Crime', 'History', 'Politics', 'American', 'Nonfiction', 'Political Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1590794580i/53638080.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53638080-fallout,319.0,4.37,37.0,"Fallout: Nuclear Bribes, Russian Spies, and the Washington Lies that Enriched the Clinton and Biden Dynasties",178.0

The face is considered the source of identity, truth, beauty, authenticity, and empathy.

But all of this rests on a specific image of the face. We might call it the ideal face.What about the strange face, the stranger's face, the face that thwarts recognition? What do we make of the face that rides the line of legibility?

Kara Dansky,English,"Most Americans do not understand the real threat that the ""transgender"" agenda, or the so-called ""gender identity"" movement, poses to all of us especially women and girls  nor do they understand the extent to which it is taking over U.S. law and civil society. The simple truth is that ""gender identity"" functions to abolish sex, and all of our civic institutions  government, media, academia, and business  have been completely captured by it. We have been told that ""transgender"" is a word to describe a marginalized group of people who are in need of civil rights protection; it is not. Instead, it is an incoherent word that is being used to advance a much broader agenda. There are many people  including people on the political left  who understand the threat that enshrining gender identity in law and society poses, but they are silenced when they try to speak out. This book shines a light on the truth about ""gender identity,"" the ""transgender"" agenda, the very real threats that they pose to all of society  specifically to the rights, privacy, and safety of women and girls  and what the global Womens Human Rights Campaign is doing to fight back.","['Gender', 'Womens', 'Politics', 'Social Change', 'LGBT', 'Transgender', 'Feminism', 'Sociology', 'Nonfiction', 'Society']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1636591234i/59589019.jpg,1637582293,9781637582299,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59589019-the-abolition-of-sex,142.0,4.24,63.0,"The Abolition of Sex: How the ""Transgender"" Agenda Harms Women and Girls",340.0

Peter Zeihan,English,"2019 was the last great year for the world economy.For generations, everything has been getting faster, better, and cheaper. Finally, we reached the point that almost anything you could ever want could be sent to your home within days - even hours - of when you decided you wanted it.America made that happen, but now America has lost interest in keeping it going.Globe-spanning supply chains are only possible with the protection of the U.S. Navy. The American dollar underpins internationalized energy and financial markets. Complex, innovative industries were created to satisfy American consumers. American security policy forced warring nations to lay down their arms. Billions of people have been fed and educated as the American-led trade system spread across the globe.All of this was artificial. All this was temporary. All this is ending.In The End of the World is Just the Beginning, author and geopolitical strategist Peter Zeihan maps out the next world: a world where countries or regions will have no choice but to make their own goods, grow their own food, secure their own energy, fight their own battles, and do it all with populations that are both shrinking and aging.The list of countries that make it all work is smaller than you think. Which means everything about our interconnected world - from how we manufacture products, to how we grow food, to how we keep the lights on, to how we shuttle stuff about, to how we pay for it all - is about to change.A world ending. A world beginning.

Helen Macdonald,English," Animals don't exist in order to teach us things, but that is what they have always done, and most of what they teach us is what we think we know about ourselves. Helen Macdonald's bestselling debut H is for Hawk brought the astonishing story of her relationship with goshawk Mabel to global critical acclaim and announced Macdonald as one of this century's most important and insightful nature writers. H is for Hawk won the Samuel Johnson Prize for Nonfiction and the Costa Book Award, and was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Kirkus Prize for Nonfiction, launching poet and falconer Macdonald as our preeminent nature essayist, with a semi-regular column in the New York Times Magazine.In Vesper Flights Helen Macdonald brings together a collection of her best loved essays, along with new pieces on topics ranging from nostalgia for a vanishing countryside to the tribulations of farming ostriches to her own private vespers while trying to fall asleep. Meditating on notions of captivity and freedom, immigration and flight, Helen invites us into her most intimate experiences: observing songbirds from the Empire State Building as they migrate through the Tribute of Light, watching tens of thousands of cranes in Hungary, seeking the last golden orioles in Suffolk's poplar forests. She writes with heart-tugging clarity about wild boar, swifts, mushroom hunting, migraines, the strangeness of birds' nests, and the unexpected guidance and comfort we find when watching wildlife. By one of this century's most important and insightful nature writers, Vesper Flights is a captivating and foundational book about observation, fascination, time, memory, love and loss and how we make sense of the world around us.","['Animals', 'Audiobook', 'Birds', 'Essays', 'Natural History', 'Memoir', 'Nature', 'Environment', 'Nonfiction', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1582053771i/48637750.jpg,0802128815,9780802128812,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48637750-vesper-flights,304.0,4.11,1296.0,Vesper Flights,7326.0

"Alastair Gee, Dani Anguiano",English,"The harrowing story of the most destructive American wildfire in a century.There is no precedent in postwar American history for the destruction of the town of Paradise, California. On November 8, 2018, the community of 27,000 people was swallowed by the ferocious Camp Fire, which razed virtually every home and killed at least 85 people. The catastrophe seared the American imagination, taking the front page of every major national newspaper and top billing on the news networks. It displaced tens of thousands of people, yielding a refugee crisis that continues to unfold.Fire in Paradise is a dramatic and moving narrative of the disaster based on hundreds of in-depth interviews with residents, firefighters and police, and scientific experts. Alastair Gee and Dani Anguiano are California-based journalists who have reported on Paradise since the day the fire began. Together they reveal the heroics of the first responders, the miraculous escapes of those who got out of Paradise, and the horrors experienced by those who were trapped. Their accounts are intimate and unforgettable, including the local who left her home on foot as fire approached while her 82-year-old father stayed to battle it; the firefighter who drove into the heart of the inferno in his bulldozer; the police officer who switched on his body camera to record what he thought would be his final moments as the flames closed in; and the mother who, less than 12 hours after giving birth in the local hospital, thought she would die in the chaotic evacuation with her baby in her lap. Gee and Anguiano also explain the science of wildfires, write powerfully about the role of the power company PG in the blaze, and describe the poignant efforts to raise Paradise from the ruins.This is the story of a town at the forefront of a devastating global shiftof a remarkable landscape sucked ever drier of moisture and becoming inhospitable even to trees, now dying in their tens of millions and turning to kindling. It is also the story of a lost community, one that epitomized a provincial, affordable kind of Californian existence that is increasingly unattainable. It is, finally, a story of a new kind of fire behavior that firefighters have never witnessed before and barely know how to handle. What happened in Paradise was unprecedented in America. Yet according to climate scientists and fire experts, it will surely happen again.","['History', 'Audiobook', 'Survival', 'Nature', 'Environment', 'True Crime', 'Nonfiction', 'Historical', 'Adult', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1581114211l/51926961.jpg,1324005149,9781324005148,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51926961-fire-in-paradise,256.0,4.01,254.0,Fire in Paradise: An American Tragedy,1538.0
Amanda Leduc,English,"In fairy tales, happy endings are the normas long as you're beautiful and walk on two legs. After all, the ogre never gets the princess. And since fairy tales are the foundational myths of our culture, how can a girl with a disability ever think she'll have a happy ending?By examining the ways that fairy tales have shaped our expectations of disability, Disfigured will point the way toward a new world where disability is no longer a punishment or impediment but operates, instead, as a way of centering a protagonist and helping them to cement their own place in a story, and from there, the world. Through the book, Leduc ruminates on the connections we make between fairy tale archetypesthe beautiful princess, the glass slipper, the maiden with long hair lost in the towerand tries to make sense of them through a twenty-first-century disablist lens. From examinations of disability in tales from the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen through to modern interpretations ranging from Disney to Angela Carter, and the fight for disabled representation in today's media, Leduc connects the fight for disability justice to the growth of modern, magical stories, and argues for increased awareness and acceptance of that which is otherhelping us to see and celebrate the magic inherent in different bodies.","['Audiobook', 'Social Justice', 'Essays', 'Memoir', 'Fairy Tales', 'Sociology', 'Feminism', 'Disability', 'Nonfiction', 'Adult']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1568929760i/45010932.jpg,1552453952,9781552453957,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45010932-disfigured,253.0,4.09,1030.0,"Disfigured: On Fairy Tales, Disability, and Making Space",5005.0

Popular and pretty, she seemed destined for a prestigious marriage, but she had other ideas. Instead, she left behind the world of society balls and chaperones to travel to the Egyptian desert, where she hoped to become a lady archaeologist, working alongside her father and Howard Carter in the hunt for an undisturbed tomb.In November 1922, their dreams came true when they discovered the burial place of Tutankhamun, packed full of gold and unimaginable riches, and she was the first person to crawl inside for three thousand years. She called it the greatest moment of her lifebut soon afterwards everything changed, with a string of tragedies that left her world a darker, sadder place.Newspapers claimed it was the curse of Tutankhamun, but Howard Carter said no rational person would entertain such nonsense.

But when catastrophe strikes, we ought to be better prepared than the Romans were when Vesuvius erupted or medieval Italians when the Black Death struck. We have science on our side, after all. Yet the responses of many developed countries to a new pathogen from China were badly bungled. Why?While populist rulers certainly performed poorly in the face of the pandemic, Niall Ferguson argues that more profound pathologies were at work - pathologies already visible in our responses to earlier disasters.Drawing from multiple disciplines, including economics and network science, Doom: The Politics of Catastrophe offers not just a history but a general theory of disaster.

Franny Choi,English,"From acclaimed poet Franny Choi comes a poetry collection for the ends of worlds--past, present, and future. Choi's third book features poems about historical and impending apocalypses, alongside musings on our responsibilities to each other and visions for our collective survival.Many have called our time dystopian. But The World Keeps Ending, and the World Goes On reminds us that apocalypse has already come in myriad ways for marginalized peoples and calls us to imagine what will persist in the aftermaths.With lyric and tonal dexterity, these poems spin backwards and forwards in time. They look into the collective psyche of our years in the pandemic and in the throes of anti-racist uprisings, while imagining other vectors, directions, and futures. Stories of survival collide across space and time--from Korean comfort women during World War II to children wandering a museum in the future. These poems explore narrative distances and queer linearity, investigating on microscopic scales before soaring towards the universal. Throughout, Choi grapples with where the individual fits within the strange landscapes of this apocalyptic world, with its violent and many-layered histories. In the process, she imagines what togetherness--between Black and Asian and other marginalized communities, between living organisms, between children of calamity and conquest--could look like. Bringing together Choi's signature speculative imagination with even greater musicality than her previous work, The World Keeps Ending, and the World Goes On ultimately charts new paths toward hope.","['Asian Literature', 'Dystopia', 'Audiobook', 'Queer', 'LGBT', 'Race', 'Poetry', 'Contemporary', 'Fiction', 'Adult']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1646648354i/60147181.jpg,0063240084,9780063240087,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60147181-the-world-keeps-ending-and-the-world-goes-on,144.0,4.0,664.0,"The World Keeps Ending, and the World Goes On",3457.0

Cassie Chambers,English,"After rising from poverty to earn two Ivy League degrees, an Appalachian lawyer pays tribute to the strong hill women who raised and inspired her, and whose values have the potential to rejuvenate a struggling regionan uplifting and eye-opening memoir for readers of Hillbilly Elegy and Educated. Nestled in the Appalachian mountains, Owsley County is one of the poorest counties in both Kentucky and the country. Buildings are crumbling and fields sit vacant, as tobacco farming and coal mining decline. But strong women are finding creative ways to subsist in their hollers in the hills. Cassie Chambers grew up in these hollers and, through the women who raised her, she traces her own path out of and back into the Kentucky mountains. Chamberss Granny was a child bride who rose before dawn every morning to raise seven children. Despite her poverty, she wouldnt hesitate to give the last bite of pie or vegetables from her garden to a struggling neighbor. Her two daughters took very different paths: strong-willed Ruththe hardest-working tobacco farmer in the countystayed on the family farm, while spirited Wilmathe sixth childbecame the first in the family to graduate from high school, then moved an hour away for college. Married at nineteen and pregnant with Cassie a few months later, Wilma beat the odds to finish school. She raised her daughter to think she could move mountains, like the ones that kept her safe but also isolated her from the larger world. Cassie would spend much of her childhood with Granny and Ruth in the hills of Owsley County, both while Wilma was in college and after. With her hill women values guiding her, Cassie went on to graduate from Harvard Law. But while the Ivy League gave her knowledge and opportunities, its privileged world felt far from her reality, and she moved back home to help her fellow rural Kentucky women by providing free legal services. Appalachian women face issues that are all too common: domestic violence, the opioid crisis, a world that seems more divided by the day. But they are also community leaders, keeping their towns together in the face of a system that continually fails them. With nuance and heart, Chambers uses these womens stories paired with her own journey to break down the myth of the hillbilly and illuminate a region whose poor communities, especially women, can lead it into the future.","['Southern', 'History', 'Womens', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir', 'Sociology', 'Feminism', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1563544650l/49249313.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49249313-hill-women,304.0,3.95,1102.0,Hill Women: Finding Family and a Way Forward in the Appalachian Mountains,7227.0

His sister, newly risen to sheriff, has just landed her first murder case, and local politicians are pushing for city police or the FBI to take the case. Are they convinced she can't handle it, or is there something else at work? She calls on Mick who, with his homicide investigation experience and familiarity with the terrain, is well-suited to staying under the radar. As he delves into the investigation, he dodges his commanding officer's increasingly urgent calls while attempting to head off further murders. And he needs to talk to his wife.The Killing Hills is a novel of betrayal--sexual, personal, within and between the clans that populate the hollers--and the way it so often shades into violence. Chris Offutt has delivered a dark, witty, and absolutely compelling novel of murder and honor, with an investigator-hero unlike any in fiction.","['Crime', 'Southern', 'Audiobook', 'Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Noir', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Family']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1617710840i/55836539.jpg,0802158412,9780802158413,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55836539-the-killing-hills,240.0,3.89,551.0,The Killing Hills,3920.0

Holly Lawford-Smith,English,"The expectation used to be that men would be masculine and women would be feminine, and this was assumed to come naturally to them in virtue of their biology. That orthodoxy persists today in many parts of society. On this view, sex is gender and gender is sex.A new view of gender has emerged in recent years, a view on which gender is an 'identity', a way that people feel about themselves in terms of masculinity or femininity, regardless of their sex. On this view, sex is dismissed as unimportant, and gender is made paramount.In the rush to celebrate this new view of gender, we have lost sight of a more powerful challenge to the traditional orthodoxy, namely the feminist sex/gender distinction according to which sex is biological and gender is social. On this view, gender is something done to people on the basis of sex. Women are socialised to conform to norms of femininity (and sanctioned for failure), and masculinity and femininity exist in a hierarchy in which femininity is devalued. This view helps us to understand injustice against women, and what we can do about it.Holly Lawford-Smith introduces and defends gender-critical feminism, a theory and movement that reclaims the sex/gender distinction, insists upon the reality and importance of sex, and continues to understand gender as a way that men and women are made to be, rather than a way they really are.","['Gender', 'Politics', 'Feminism', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1649737128i/60797771.jpg,0198863888,9780198863885,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60797771-gender-critical-feminism,320.0,3.84,14.0,Gender-Critical Feminism,70.0

"Todd Erzen, Steve Deace",English,"#1 Wall Street Journal Bestseller As seen on Tucker Carlson Tonight As heard on Glenn Beck and Mark Levin In his famous Farewell Address, President Eisenhower warned about allowing public policy to become captive to a scientific elite without regard to the principles of our constitutional system and the goals of a free society. Eisenhower was prescient. During the COVID crisis, states like New York that embraced unadulterated Faucism saw poor results across the board, while states that pursued an Eisenhower-style approach like Florida protected freedom and performed better in education, economy and health outcomes. Executives are elected to lead and make tough decisions, and such leadership cannot be outsourced to health bureaucrats like Fauci. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis In this important book the authors do the job our uninquisitive media has failed to do throughout this ordeal. Confirming with cited and sourced details the enemy of both liberty and logic the lockdowns have proven to be. Which also proves too much power in the hands of an unelected bureaucrat, regardless of his intentions, can no longer be our new normal. U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) Can liberty survive in the hands of one all-powerful, unchallenged, and unelected bureaucrat? It wasnt too long ago that the average American didnt know who Anthony Fauci was. Now, after the coronavirus has spread nationwide, hes arguably the most powerful bureaucrat in American history. But is it dangerous for a free society to concentrate so much power in the hands of an unelected official? Who or what holds Fauci accountable? Steve Deace is a true patriot whose zeal for liberty is undeniable. Every day, Steve walks the walk when it comes to fighting for Americans' fundamental rights. This book is written with a keen understanding of the pain and devastation we've all seen throughout this pandemic. Throughout, Steve's passion for protecting Americans' freedoms is ever-present. U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (TX) This is an important book, to both get answers to how we got here and to help us never succumb to something like this ever again. Permitting unelected bureaucrats to hold this much power indefinitely doesn't end well. Mark Levin, New York Times best-selling author and talk show host In their typical fashion, Steve Deace and Todd Erzen spare no expense in pursuit of truth. Weve been told a lot of things during this pandemic, and a lot of them contradict each other. This book uses documented data and sources to cut through the clutter, most of it Faucis, and bring us to a place of reason and science.

Thomas Halliday,English,"A stirring, eye-opening journey into deep time,  from the Ice Age to the first appearance of microbial life 550 million years ago, by a brilliant young paleobiologistThe past is past, but it does leave clues, and Thomas Halliday has used cutting-edge science to decipher them more completely than ever before. In Otherlands,  Halliday makes sixteen fossil sites burst to life on the page.This book is an exploration of the Earth as it used to exist, the changes that have occurred during its history, and the ways that life has found to adaptor not. It takes us from the savannahs of Pliocene Kenya to watch a python chase a group of australopithecines into an acacia tree; to a cliff overlooking the salt pans of the empty basin of what will be the Mediterranean Sea just as water from the Miocene Atlantic Ocean spills in; into the tropical forests of Eocene Antarctica; and under the shallow pools of Ediacaran Australia, where we glimpse the first microbial life.Otherlands also offers us a vast perspective on the current state of the planet. The thought that something as vast as the Great Barrier Reef, for example, with all its vibrant diversity, might one day soon be gone sounds improbable. But the fossil record shows us that this sort of wholesale change is not only possible but has repeatedly happened throughout Earth history.Even as he operates on this broad canvas, Halliday brings us up close to the intricate relationships that defined these lost worlds. In novelistic prose that belies the breadth of his research, he illustrates how ecosystems are formed; how species die out and are replaced; and how species migrate, adapt, and collaborate. It is a breathtaking achievement: a surprisingly emotional narrative about the persistence of life, the fragility of seemingly permanent ecosystems, and the scope of deep time, all of which have something to tell us about our current crisis.","['History', 'Biology', 'Animals', 'Natural History', 'Palaeontology', 'Evolution', 'Nature', 'Environment', 'Nonfiction', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1638151551i/58065802.jpg,0593132882,9780593132883,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58065802-otherlands,385.0,4.14,626.0,Otherlands: A Journey Through Earth's Extinct Worlds,4039.0

However, the truth is that in many respects progress is stalling, or even falling back.Sharron Davies is no stranger to battling the routine sexism the sporting world.

Ryan  Clark,English,"While it may be true that art cannot redeem the flaws of our deleterious society, it can often reveal more anodyne alternatives nested neatly inside the familiar. Such is the vision of Ryan Clark's ARIZONA SB 1070: AN ACT, a homophonic translation that writes against the hateful and xenophobic 2010 Arizona anti-immigration law that gives the book its title and emerged as a harbinger of much vileness in word and deed during the long decade that followed its passing. Clark's translation innovatively rescripts the bill and calls to the fore the contested nature of language in Arizona. His deft choices and rigorous techniques destabilize and transform the letters of the law itself, using linguistic processes and a keen poet's ear to morph the bill's divisive language into tender, vulnerable, and compassionate lyric poetry that seeks to untangle knots of unease and advocate for healing. While interrogating and investigating the fear of immigrants that buttresses a climate of oppression in which a bill like Arizona SB 1070 becomes law, Clark's work also pursues a public space where difficult dialogues about the wounds such legislation has continued to open--and reopen--are paramount.

Kendi, National Book Awardwinning author of How to Be an Antiracist ) in this compelling collection of engaging, well-written, keenly observed vignettes from [Laura Coatess] years as a lawyer with the US Department of Justice ( The New York Times Book Review ).When Laura Coates joined the Department of Justice as a prosecutor, she wanted to advocate for the most vulnerable among us. But she quickly realized that even with the best intentions, the pursuit of justice creates injustice.Coatess experiences show that no matter how fair you try to fight, being Black, a woman, and a mother are identities often at odds in the justice system. She and her colleagues face seemingly impossible situations as they teeter between what is right and what is just.On the front lines of our legal system, Coates saw how Black communities are policed differently; Black cases are prosecuted differently; Black defendants are judged differently. How the court system seems to be the one place where minorities are overrepresented, an unrelenting parade of Black and Brown defendants in numbers that belie their percentage in the population and overfill American prisons. She also witnessed how others in the system either abused power or were abused by itfor example, when an undocumented witness was arrested by ICE, when a white colleague taught Coates how to unfairly interrogate a young Black defendant, or when a judge victim-blamed a young sexual assault survivor based on her courtroom attire.Through these searing, eye-opening ( People ) scenes from the courtroom, Laura Coates explores the tension between the idealism of the law and the reality of working within the parameters of our flawed legal system, exposing the chasm between what is right and what is lawful.","['Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Social Justice', 'Biography Memoir', 'Law', 'Memoir', 'Race', 'Biography', 'True Crime', 'Nonfiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1640285119i/58438599.jpg,1982173769,9781982173760,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58438599-just-pursuit,272.0,4.2,253.0,Just Pursuit: A Black Prosecutor's Fight for Fairness,1616.0

Suleika Jaouad,English,"A searing, deeply moving memoir of illness and recovery that traces one young womans journey from diagnosis to remission and, ultimately, a road trip of healing and self-discovery.In the summer after graduating from college, Suleika Jaouad was preparing, as they say in commencement speeches, to enter ""the real world"". She had fallen in love and moved to Paris to pursue her dream of becoming a war correspondent. The real world she found, however, would take her into a very different kind of conflict zone.It started with an itch - first on her feet, then up her legs, like 1,000 invisible mosquito bites. Next came the exhaustion, and the six-hour naps that only deepened her fatigue. Then a trip to the doctor and, a few weeks shy of her 23rd birthday, a diagnosis: leukemia, with a 35 percent chance of survival. Just like that, the life she had imagined for herself had gone up in flames. By the time Jaouad flew home to New York, she had lost her job, her apartment, and her independence. She would spend much of the next four years in a hospital bed, fighting for her life and chronicling the saga in a column for The New York Times.When Jaouad finally walked out of the cancer ward - after three and a half years of chemo, a clinical trial, and a bone marrow transplant - she was, according to the doctors, cured. But as she would soon learn, a cure is not where the work of healing ends; its where it begins. She had spent the past 1,500 days in desperate pursuit of one goal - to survive. And now that shed done so, she realized that she had no idea how to live.How would she reenter the world and live again? How could she reclaim what had been lost? Jaouad embarked - with her new best friend, Oscar, a scruffy terrier mutt - on a 100-day, 15,000-mile road trip across the country. She set out to meet some of the strangers who had written to her during her years in the hospital: a teenage girl in Florida also recovering from cancer; a teacher in California grieving the death of her son; a death-row inmate in Texas whod spent his own years confined to a room. What she learned on this trip is that the divide between sick and well is porous, that the vast majority of us will travel back and forth between these realms throughout our lives. Between Two Kingdoms is a profound chronicle of survivorship and a fierce, tender, and inspiring exploration of what it means to begin again.","['Travel', 'Audiobook', 'Medicine', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Health', 'Nonfiction', 'Autobiography', 'Medical']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1579614170i/50743767.jpg,0399588582,9780399588587,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50743767-between-two-kingdoms,352.0,4.43,8327.0,Between Two Kingdoms: A Memoir of a Life Interrupted,89369.0

In the process, she learns what it means to be descended from women with souls of iron--women who have protected their families, their traditions, and a precious cache of seeds through generations of hardship and loss, through war and the insidious trauma of boarding schools.Weaving together the voices of four indelible women, The Seed Keeper is a beautifully told story of reawakening, of remembering our original relationship to the seeds and, through them, to our ancestors.","['Adult', 'Book Club', 'Audiobook', 'Nature', 'Family', 'Adult Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1605580185i/52639051.jpg,1571311378,9781571311375,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52639051-the-seed-keeper,372.0,4.31,1918.0,The Seed Keeper,15184.0

Often used as a safeguard against copyright infringement.Peter Winceworth, a disaffected Victorian lexicographer, inserts false entries into a dictionary  violating and subverting the dictionarys authority  in an attempt to assert some sense of individual purpose and artistic freedom. In the present day, Mallory, a young overworked and underpaid intern employed by the dictionarys publishing house, is tasked with uncovering these entries before the work is digitised. As the novel progresses and their narratives combine, as Winceworth imagines who will find his fictional words in an unknown future and Mallory discovers more about the anonymous lexicographers life through the clues left in his fictitious entries, both discover how they might negotiate the complexities of an absurd, relentless, untrustworthy, hoax-strewn, undefinable life.Braiding together contemporary and historical narratives, the novel explores themes of trust, agency and creativity, celebrating the rigidity, fragility and absurdity of language.Running time: 7 hours and 55 minutes","['Adult', 'Books About Books', 'Audiobook', 'Queer', 'LGBT', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1610683449i/56672286.jpg,0593348877,9780593348871,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56672286-the-liar-s-dictionary,8.0,3.37,1938.0,The Liar's Dictionary,10002.0

Katherine Addison,English,"Katherine Addison returns to the glittering world she created for her beloved novel, 'The Goblin Emperor', in this stand-alone sequel.When the young half-goblin emperor Maia sought to learn who had killed his father and half-brothers, he turned to an obscure resident of his Court, a Prelate of Ulis and a Witness for the Dead. Thara Celehar found the truth, though it did him no good to discover it. He lost his place as a retainer of his cousin the former Empress, and made far too many enemies among the many factions vying for power in the new Court. The favor of the Emperor is a dangerous coin.Now Celehar lives in the city of Amalo, far from the Court though not exactly in exile. He has not escaped from politics, but his position gives him the ability to serve the common people of the city, which is his preference. He lives modestly, but his decency and fundamental honesty will not permit him to live quietly. As a Witness for the Dead, he can, sometimes, speak to the recently dead: see the last thing they saw, know the last thought they had, experience the last thing they felt. it is his duty to use that ability to resolve disputes, to ascertain the intent of the dead, to find the killers of the murdered.Celehar's skills now lead him out of the quiet and into a morass of treachery, murder, and injustice. No matter his own background with the imperial house, Celehar will stand with the commoners, and possibly find a light in the darkness.","['Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Queer', 'Audiobook', 'LGBT', 'Mystery', 'Steampunk', 'High Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Adult']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1603852509i/41302953.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41302953-the-witness-for-the-dead,240.0,4.11,1540.0,The Witness for the Dead,9500.0

Nicole Saphier,English,"Follow the science is what they said. Follow our politics is what they meant.InPanic Attack, nationally bestselling author and physician Nicole Saphier uncovers the hypocrisy and hysteria which has characterized so much of the American pandemic response. While journalists trumpeted the importance of following science to flatten the curve, they praised Governors Andrew Cuomo and Phil Murphy, who sanctioned ill-equipped nursing homes to take COVID-positive patients, leading to an enormous death spike for New York and New Jersey. Plus, the old guard medical establishment captured by Dr. Fauci proved to be far too rigidduring a health care emergency.While some state legislators are still concealing accurate records of nursing home deaths, many others have made anti-science decisions regarding re-opening plans; all of which fuel distrust and civil unrest. Democrat mayors like Bill de Blasio openly admitted that their decisions to keep schools closed were fueled by a social contract with teachers (that teachers unions), despite hard science saying this would be harmful.When anti-science measures are continuously implemented, the long-term consequences of such actions will likely stay with us for years to come. The pandemic has resulted in a failure of government, much of which is unavoidable in a unique disaster scenario. However, the rampant politicization of science, from the origin of the virus to the simple concept of wearing facemasks, has hopelessly muddied the water, divided the country, and knee-jerk anti-Trumpism made it all worse.","['Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Audiobook']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1616495523i/57503909.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57503909-panic-attack,317.0,4.02,21.0,Panic Attack: Playing Politics with Science in the Fight Against COVID-19,121.0

Helen   Lewis,English,"Well-behaved women dont make history: difficult women do. Feminisms success is down to complicated, contradictory, imperfect women, who fought each other as well as fighting for equal rights. Helen Lewis argues that too many of these pioneers have been whitewashed or forgotten in our modern search for feel-good, inspirational heroines. Its time to reclaim the history of feminism as a history of difficult women.In this book, youll meet the working-class suffragettes who advocated bombings and arson; the princess who discovered why so many women were having bad sex; the pioneer of the refuge movement who became a mens rights activist; the striker in a sari who terrified Margaret Thatcher; the wronged Victorian wife who definitely wasnt sleeping with the prime minister; and the lesbian politician who outraged the country. Taking the story up to the present with the twenty-first-century campaign for abortion services, Helen Lewis reveals the unvarnished  and unfinished  history of womens rights.Drawing on archival research and interviews, Difficult Women is a funny, fearless and sometimes shocking narrative history, which shows why the feminist movement has succeeded  and what it should do next.

Science Fictions reveals the disturbing flaws that undermine our understanding of all of these fields and more.While the scientific method will always be our best and only way of knowing about the world, in reality the current system of funding and publishing science not only fails to safeguard against scientists inescapable biases and foibles, it actively encourages them.

In this vital investigation, he gathers together the evidence of their full and shocking extent  and how a new reform movement within science is fighting back.

Paulina Bren,English,"From award-winning author Paulina Bren comes the remarkable history of New Yorks most famous residential hotel and the women who stayed there, including Grace Kelly, Sylvia Plath, and Joan Didion.Welcome to New Yorks legendary hotel for women, the Barbizon. Liberated after WWI from home and hearth, women flocked to New York City during the Roaring Twenties. But even as womens residential hotels became the fashion, the Barbizon stood out; it was designed for young women with artistic aspirations, and included soaring art studios and soundproofed practice rooms. More importantly still, with no men allowed beyond the lobby, the Barbizon signaled respectability, a place where a young woman of a certain class could feel at home.  But as the stock market crashed and the Great Depression set in, the clientele changed, though womens ambitions did not; the Barbizon Hotel became the go-to destination for any young American woman with a dream to be something more. While Sylvia Plath most famously fictionalized her time there in The Bell Jar, the Barbizon was also where Titanic survivor Molly Brown sang her last aria; where Grace Kelly danced topless in the hallways; where Joan Didion got her first taste of Manhattan; and where both Ali MacGraw and Jaclyn Smith found their calling as actresses. Students of the prestigious Katharine Gibbs Secretarial School had three floors to themselves, Eileen Ford used the hotel as a guest house for her youngest models, and Mademoiselle magazine boarded its summer interns there, including a young designer named Betsey Johnson.  The first ever history of this extraordinary hotel, and of the women who arrived in New York City alone from elsewhere with a suitcase and a dream, The Barbizon offers readers a multilayered history of New York City in the 20th century, and of the generations of American women torn between their desire for independence and their looming social expiration date. By providing women a room of their own, the Barbizon was the hotel that set them free.","['History', 'Womens', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'New York', 'Feminism', 'Biography', 'American History', 'Nonfiction', 'Historical']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1612105261i/54304210.jpg,1982123893,9781982123895,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54304210-the-barbizon,336.0,3.68,1028.0,The Barbizon: The Hotel That Set Women Free,5586.0

It is always a rabbi who makes a golem, and always in a time of crisis.But Len Bronstein is no rabbihes a Brooklyn art teacher who steals a large quantity of clay from his school, gets extremely stoned, and manages to bring his creation to life despite knowing little about Judaism and even less about golems.

When Miri shows him a video of white nationalists marching and chanting Jews will not replace us, the answer becomes clear.The Golem of Brooklyn is an epic romp through Jewish history and the American present that wrestles with the deepest questions of our humanitythe conflicts between faith and skepticism, tribalism and interdependence, and vengeance and healing.","['Jewish', 'Magical Realism', 'Humor', 'New York', 'Judaism', 'Judaica', 'Religion', 'Mythology', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1684816855i/124019742.jpg,059372982X,9780593729823,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/124019742-the-golem-of-brooklyn,272.0,4.02,265.0,The Golem of Brooklyn,1446.0
Eliot Higgins,English,"The page-turning inside account of the organization solving international mysteries and wielding the power of the internet to fight for facts.In 2018, Russian exile Sergei Skripal and his daughter were nearly killed in an audacious poisoning attempt in Salisbury, England. Soon, the identity of one of the suspects was revealed: he was a Russian spy. This huge investigative coup wasn't pulled off by an intelligence agency or a traditional news outlet. Instead, the scoop came from Bellingcat, the open-source investigative team that is redefining the way we think about news, politics, and the digital future.We Are Bellingcat tells the inspiring story of how a college dropout pioneered a new category of reporting and galvanized citizen journalists-working together from their computer screens around the globe-to crack major cases, at a time when fact-based journalism is under assault from authoritarian forces. Founder Eliot Higgins introduces readers to the tools Bellingcat investigators use, tools available to anyone, from software that helps you pinpoint the location of an image, to an app that can nail down the time that photo was taken. This book digs deep into some of Bellingcat's most important investigations-the downing of flight MH17 over Ukraine, Assad's use of chemical weapons in Syria, the identities of alt-right protestors in Charlottesville-with the drama and gripping detail of a spy novel.","['Crime', 'History', 'Politics', 'War', 'Russia', 'Technology', 'Espionage', 'True Crime', 'Nonfiction', 'Journalism']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1596434293i/54680228.jpg,1635577306,9781635577303,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54680228-we-are-bellingcat,272.0,4.13,473.0,"We Are Bellingcat: Global Crime, Online Sleuths, and the Bold Future of News",4664.0

Once the party of anti-communism and tax-cutting under President Kennedy, it is now dominated by a surging socialist movement and led by a presidential candidate who vows to transform America. On a near-daily basis, the Democrats are issuing radical proposals to socialize medicine, industry, and higher education. So how can the Democrats win elections when their agenda is so far to the left of the American people? Thats easyits because the means of public debate are being manipulated.

"Michael Yarvitz, Rachel Maddow",English,"The untold story of the other scandal that rocked Nixon's White House: the wild crimes, audacious cover-up, and spectacular downfall of Vice President Spiro Agnew - with new reporting that expands on Rachel Maddow's Peabody Award-nominated podcast.Is it possible for an American vice president to direct a vast criminal enterprise within the halls of the White House? To have one of the most brazen corruption scandals in American history play out while nobody's paying attention? And for that scandal to be all but forgotten decades later?The year was 1973, and the vice president in question was Spiro T. Agnew, Richard Nixon's second-in-command. Long on firebrand rhetoric and short on political experience, Agnew had carried out a bribery and extortion ring in office for years, when--at the height of Watergate--three young federal prosecutors discovered his crimes and launched a mission to take him down before it was too late. Before Nixon's downfall made way for Agnew to ascend to the presidency himself. Agnew did everything he could to bury their investigation: dismissing it as a ""witch hunt,"" riling up his partisan base, making the press the enemy, and, with a crumbling circle of loyalists, scheming to obstruct justice.In this blockbuster account, Rachel Maddow and Michael Yarvitz detail the investigation that exposed Agnew's crimes, the attempts at a cover-up - which involved future President George H. W. Bush - and the bargain that forced Agnew's resignation but also spared him years in federal prison. Based on the hit podcast, Bag Man expands and deepens the story of Spiro Agnew's scandal and its lasting influence on our politics, our media, and our understanding of what it takes to confront a criminal in the White House.","['Crime', 'History', 'Politics', 'Biography Memoir', 'American History', 'Presidents', 'Biography', 'True Crime', 'Nonfiction', 'Historical']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1612708957i/52630443.jpg,0593136683,9780593136683,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52630443-bag-man,291.0,4.31,839.0,"Bag Man: The Wild Crimes, Audacious Cover-Up, and Spectacular Downfall of a Brazen Crook in the White House",6972.0

Johann Hari,English,"Our ability to pay attention is collapsing. From the New York Times bestselling author of Chasing the Scream and Lost Connections comes a groundbreaking examination of why this is happening--and how to get our attention back. In the United States, teenagers can focus on one task for only sixty-five seconds at a time, and office workers average only three minutes. Like so many of us, Johann Hari was finding that constantly switching from device to device and tab to tab was a diminishing and depressing way to live. He tried all sorts of self-help solutions--even abandoning his phone for three months--but nothing seemed to work. So Hari went on an epic journey across the world to interview the leading experts on human attention--and he discovered that everything we think we know about this crisis is wrong.We think our inability to focus is a personal failure to exert enough willpower over our devices. The truth is even more disturbing: our focus has been stolen by powerful external forces that have left us uniquely vulnerable to corporations determined to raid our attention for profit. Hari found that there are twelve deep causes of this crisis, from the decline of mind-wandering to rising pollution, all of which have robbed some of our attention. In Stolen Focus,  he introduces readers to Silicon Valley dissidents who learned to hack human attention, and veterinarians who diagnose dogs with ADHD. He explores a favela in Rio de Janeiro where everyone lost their attention in a particularly surreal way, and an office in New Zealand that discovered a remarkable technique to restore workers' productivity.Crucially, Hari learned how we can reclaim our focus--as individuals, and as a society--if we are determined to fight for it. Stolen Focus will transform the debate about attention and finally show us how to get it back.","['Self Help', 'Audiobook', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Technology', 'Health', 'Productivity', 'Nonfiction', 'Mental Health', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1626718328i/57933306.jpg,0593138511,9780593138519,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57933306-stolen-focus,357.0,4.24,5851.0,Stolen Focus: Why You Can't Pay Attention— and How to Think Deeply Again,50488.0

Hannah Barnes,English,"Time to Think goes behind the headlines to reveal the truth about the NHSs flagship gender service for children.The Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS), based at the Tavistock and Portman Trust in North London, was set up initially to provide  for the most part  talking therapies to young people who were questioning their gender identity. But in the last decade GIDS has referred more than a thousand children, some as young as nine years old, for medication to block their puberty. In the same period, the number of referrals has exploded, increasing thirty-fold, while the profile of the patients has changed, from largely pre-pubescent boys to mostly adolescent girls, who are often contending with other difficulties.Why had the patients changed so dramatically? Were all these distressed young people actually best served by taking puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones? While some young people appeared to thrive after taking the blocker, many seemed to become worse. Was there enough clinical evidence to justify such profound medical interventions in the lives of young people who had so much else to contend with?This urgent, scrupulous and dramatic book explains how, in the words of some former staff, GIDS has been the site of a serious medical scandal, in which ideological concerns took priority over clinical practice. Award-winning journalist Hannah Barnes has had unprecedented access to thousands of pages of documents, including internal emails and unpublished reports, and over a hundred hours of personal testimony, to write a disturbing and gripping parable of our times.","['Gender', 'Politics', 'Psychology', 'LGBT', 'Sociology', 'Feminism', 'Transgender', 'Health', 'Nonfiction', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1676210993i/62814704.jpg,1800751117,9781800751118,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62814704-time-to-think,455.0,4.42,158.0,Time to Think: The Inside Story of the Collapse of the Tavistock's Gender Service for Children,881.0

So begins Marigold and Rose, Louise Glck's astonishing chronicle of the first year in the life of twin girls. Imagine a fairy tale that is also a multi-generational saga; a piece for two hands that is also a symphony; a poem that is also, in the spirit of Kafka's Metamorphosis, an incandescent act of autobiography.Here are the elements you'd expect to find in a story of infant twins--Father and Mother, Grandmother and Other Grandmother, bath time and nap time--but more than that, Marigold and Rose is an investigation of the great mystery of language and of time itself, of what is and what has been and what will be.

Presidents have come and gone, but she has hosted them all. Growing up in the modest farmlands of Battle Creek, Michigan, Marjorie was inspired by a few simple rules: always think for yourself, never take success for granted, and work hardeven when deemed American royalty, even while covered in imperial diamonds. Marjorie had an insatiable drive to live and love and to give more than she got.

Marjorie's journey began gluing cereal boxes in her father's barn as a young girl. No one could have predicted that C. W.

Not content to stay in her prescribed roles of high-society wife, mother, and hostess, Marjorie dared to demand more, making history in the process. Before turning thirty she amassed millions, becoming the wealthiest woman in the United States. But it was her life-force, advocacy, passion, and adventurous spirit that led to her stunning legacy. And yet Marjorie's story, though full of beauty and grandeur, set in the palatial homes she built such as Mar-a-Lago, was equally marked by challenge and tumult. A wife four times over, Marjorie sought her happily-ever-after with the blue-blooded party boy who could not outrun his demons, the charismatic financier whose charm turned to betrayal, the international diplomat with a dark side, and the bon vivant whose shocking secrets would shake Marjorie and all of society. Marjorie did everything on a grand scale, especially when it came to love. Bestselling and acclaimed author Allison Pataki has crafted an intimate portrait of a larger-than-life woman, a powerful story of one woman falling in love with her own voice and embracing her own power while shaping history in the process.","['Adult', 'Book Club', 'Audiobook', 'Romance', 'Chick Lit', 'Adult Fiction', 'American History', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1626717206i/57792084.jpg,0593355687,9780593355688,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57792084-the-magnificent-lives-of-marjorie-post,400.0,4.15,4557.0,The Magnificent Lives of Marjorie Post,48878.0

"Orhan Pamuk, Pelin Kvrak, Erda M. Gknar",English,"In over thirty interviews ranging from 1982 until 2022, Conversations with Orhan Pamuk reveals a writer of intense literary and political engagement. Nobel Laureate Orhan Pamuk (b. 1952) is a foremost practitioner of the global novel today. His work, informed by Turkish and world literary canons, has been translated into over sixty languages and sold over fifteen million copies globally.This volume presents an alternative literary history that traces the dominant themes of the authors oeuvre. As the interviews show, Pamuks work makes allusions to literary texts from Eastern and Western traditions in a hybrid manner. Furthermore, Pamuk writes on the fault line between historical and literary idioms, playing with genres like a painter does with colors, interweaving romance, detective story, murder mystery, mythology, and autobiography. The interviews establish that a Pamuk novel is predicated on methodical research, at times archival and scholarly, investigative and journalistic, or ethnographic. One could say the Pamuk novel is method. His fictions are constructed through intricate clockwork and delve into, for example, specialized knowledge of an Ottoman historical era, Islamic miniature painting, coups, museums, Istanbul street vendors, conspiracy, and plagues. Pamuks interviews, in turn, are necessarily instructive and edifying as much as they are entertaining, opening windows onto the novelist's everyday life, craft, and process.",,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1683040310i/143175628.jpg,1496849426,9781496849427,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/143175628-conversations-with-orhan-pamuk,185.0,4.0,,Conversations with Orhan Pamuk,1.0

"Dena Takruri, Ahed Tamimi",English,"A Palestinian activist jailed at sixteen after a confrontation with Israeli soldiers illuminates the daily struggles of life under occupation in this moving, deeply personal memoir.I cannot even begin to convey the clarity, the intensity, the power, the photographic storytelling of They Called Me a Lioness.Ibram X. Kendi, internationally bestselling author of How to Be an AntiracistONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: Kirkus ReviewsWhat would you do if you grew up seeing your home repeatedly raided? Your parents arrested? Your mother shot? Your uncle killed? Try, for just a moment, to imagine that this was your life. How would you want the world to react?Ahed Tamimi is a world-renowned Palestinian activist, born and raised in the small West Bank village of Nabi Saleh, which became a center of the resistance to Israeli occupation when an illegal, Jewish-only settlement blocked off its community spring. Tamimi came of age participating in nonviolent demonstrations against this action and the occupation at large. Her global renown reached an apex in December 2017, when, at sixteen years old, she was filmed slapping an Israeli soldier who refused to leave her front yard. The video went viral, and Tamimi was arrested.But this is not just a story of activism or imprisonment. It is the human-scale story of an occupation that has riveted the world and shaped global politics, from a girl who grew up in the middle of it . Tamimis father was born in 1967, the year that Israel began its occupation of the West Bank and he grew up immersed in the resistance movement. One of Tamimis earliest memories is visiting him in prison, poking her toddler fingers through the fence to touch his hand. She herself would spend her seventeenth birthday behind bars. Living through this greatest test and heightened attacks on her village, Tamimi felt her resolve only deepen, in tension with her attempts to live the normal life of a daughter, sibling, friend, and student.An essential addition to an important conversation, They Called Me a Lioness shows us what is at stake in this struggle and offers a fresh vision for resistance. With their unflinching, riveting storytelling, Ahed Tamimi and Dena Takruri shine a light on the humanity not just in occupied Palestine but also in the unsung lives of people struggling for freedom around the world.","['History', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Social Justice', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir', 'Education', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Adult']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1700931852i/202678162.jpg,,9780593610992,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/202678162-they-called-me-a-lioness,,4.7,533.0,They Called Me a Lioness: A Palestinian Girls Fight for Freedom,2616.0

Elizabeth  Williamson,English,"Based on hundreds of hours of research, interviews, and access to exclusive sources and materials, Sandy Hook is Elizabeth Williamsons landmark investigation of the aftermath of a school shooting, the work of Sandy Hook parents who fought to defend themselves, and the truth of their childrens fate against the frenzied distortions of online deniers and conspiracy theorists. On December 14, 2012, a gunman killed twenty first-graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Ten years later, Sandy Hook has become a foundational story of how false conspiracy narratives and malicious misinformation have gained traction in society. One of the nations most devastating mass shootings, Sandy Hook was used to create destructive and painful myths. Driven by ideology or profit, or for no sound reason at all, some people insisted it never occurred, or was staged by the federal government as a pretext for seizing Americans firearms. They tormented the victims relatives online, accosted them on the street and at memorial events, accusing them of faking their loved ones murders. Some family members have been stalked and forced into hiding. A gun was fired into the home of one parent. Present at the creation of this terrible crusade was Alex Joness Infowars, a far-right outlet that aired noxious Sandy Hook theories to millions and raised money for the conspiracy theorists quest to prove the shooting didnt happen. Enabled by Facebook, YouTube, and other social media companies failure to curb harmful content, the conspiracists questions grew into suspicion, suspicion grew into demands for more proof, and unanswered demands turned into rage. This pattern of denial and attack would come to characterize some Americans response to almost every major event, from mass shootings to the coronavirus pandemic to the 2020 presidential election, in which President Trumps false claims of a rigged result prompted the January 6, 2021, assault on a bastion of democracy, the U.S. Capitol.The Sandy Hook families, led by the father of the youngest victim, refused to accept this. Sandy Hook is the story of their battle to preserve their loved ones legacies even in the face of threats to their own lives. Through exhaustive reporting, narrative storytelling, and intimate portraits, Sandy Hook is the definitive book on one of the most shocking cultural ruptures of the internet era.","['Crime', 'History', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Psychology', 'American History', 'Sociology', 'True Crime', 'Nonfiction', 'Journalism']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1641236528i/59546340.jpg,,9781524746575,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59546340-sandy-hook,482.0,4.3,493.0,Sandy Hook,3109.0

Adrian Wooldridge,English,"Meritocracy: the idea that people should be advanced according to their talents rather than their birth. While this initially seemed like a novel concept, by the end of the twentieth century it had become the world's ruling ideology. How did this happen, and why is meritocracy now under attack from both right and left? In The Aristocracy of Talent, esteemed journalist and historian Adrian Wooldridge traces the history of meritocracy forged by the politicians and officials who introduced the revolutionary principle of open competition, the psychologists who devised methods for measuring natural mental abilities, and the educationalists who built ladders of educational opportunity. He looks outside western cultures and shows what transformative effects it has had everywhere it has been adopted, especially once women were brought into the meritocratic system. Wooldridge also shows how meritocracy has now become corrupted and argues that the recent stalling of social mobility is the result of failure to complete the meritocratic revolution. Rather than abandoning meritocracy, he says, we should call for its renewal.","['History', 'Politics', 'Cultural', 'Education', 'Economics', 'Sociology', 'Philosophy', 'Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Society']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1621771307i/57694575.jpg,1510768610,9781510768611,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57694575-the-aristocracy-of-talent,504.0,3.87,47.0,The Aristocracy of Talent: How Meritocracy Made the Modern World,391.0

Greg  Jenner,English,"Celebrity, with its neon glow and selfie pout, strikes us as hypermodern. But the famous and infamous have been thrilling, titillating, and outraging us for much longer than we might realise. Whether it was the scandalous Lord Byron, whose poetry sent female fans into an erotic frenzy; or the cheetah-owning, coffin-sleeping, one-legged French actress Sarah Bernhardt, who launched a violent feud with her former best friend; or Edmund Kean, the dazzling Shakespearean actor whose monstrous ego and terrible alcoholism saw him nearly murdered by his own audience - the list of stars whose careers burned bright before the Age of Television is extensive and thrillingly varied.Celebrities could be heroes or villains; warriors or murderers; brilliant talents, or fraudsters with a flair for fibbing; trendsetters, wilful provocateurs, or tragic victims marketed as freaks of nature. Some craved fame while others had it forced upon them. A few found fame as small children, some had to wait decades to get their break. But uniting them all is the shared origin point: since the early 1700s, celebrity has been one of the most emphatic driving forces in popular culture; it is a lurid cousin to Ancient Greek ideas of glorious and notorious reputation, and its emergence helped to shape public attitudes to ethics, national identity, religious faith, wealth, sexuality, and gender roles.In this ambitious history, that spans the Bronze Age to the coming of Hollywood's Golden Age, Greg Jenner assembles a vibrant cast of over 125 actors, singers, dancers, sportspeople, freaks, demigods, ruffians, and more, in search of celebrity's historical roots. He reveals why celebrity burst into life in the early eighteenth century, how it differs to ancient ideas of fame, the techniques through which it was acquired, how it was maintained, the effect it had on public tastes, and the psychological burden stardom could place on those in the glaring limelight. DEAD FAMOUS is a surprising, funny, and fascinating exploration of both a bygone age and how we came to inhabit our modern, fame obsessed society.","['History', 'Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Humor', 'Sociology', 'Biography', 'Pop Culture', 'Nonfiction', 'Historical']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1592168787i/52700780.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52700780-dead-famous,13.0,3.81,351.0,Dead Famous: An Unexpected History of Celebrity from Bronze Age to Silver Screen,2880.0

Marisa G. Franco,English,"
  A lively, data-driven guide to finding your people from psychologist Dr. Marisa G. Franco about the (sometimes surprising) science behind making friends, maintaining them, and building connections of ALL sorts in an era of social fragmentation and rampant loneliness.
Loneliness is an epidemic, in part due to a culture that prioritizes romance at the expense of all other relationships. But in fact, science shows that platonic friendships are a crucial--possibly THE crucial--key to shaping who we are and how we can become our happiest, most fulfilled selves. So how do we nurture meaningful relationships in an era of distraction, burnout, and chaos?Just as economist Emily Oster (Crib Sheet) breaks down the science of child-rearing by countering fables with facts, psychologist and professor Marissa G. Franco unpacks the latest (often counterintuitive) findings about friendship--for example, why your friends aren't texting you back (it's not because they hate you!), and the myth of ""just showing up"" (you need to bring more than your mere presence to the table to make real friends!). Forging lasting bonds with other people isn't rocket science...but it does take work, and there are research-based ways to improve the number and quality of your connections. The good news: the benefits can be massive to not just our sense of wellbeing but also to our physical health.With vivid, relatable storytelling bolstered by the latest psychological research, Platonic provides a clear and actionable blueprint for understanding and conquering the barriers that keep you from forging strong, lasting connections with others. In short, Platonic will give you permission to hold friendship in the highest regard--because it deserves to be.","['Self Help', 'Audiobook', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Sociology', 'Relationships', 'Health', 'Nonfiction', 'Mental Health', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1648411413i/59883574.jpg,0593331893,9780593331897,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59883574-platonic,336.0,4.05,787.0,Platonic: How the Science of Attachment Can Help You Make—and Keep—Friends,5391.0

"Ekin Oklap, Orhan Pamuk",English,"From the the winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature: Part detective story, part historical epic--a bold and brilliant novel that imagines a plague ravaging a fictional island in the Ottoman Empire.It is April 1900, in the Levant, on the imaginary island of Mingheria--the twenty-ninth state of the Ottoman Empire--located in the eastern Mediterranean between Crete and Cyprus. Half the population is Muslim, the other half are Orthodox Greeks, and tension is high between the two. When a plague arrives--brought either by Muslim pilgrims returning from the Mecca or by merchant vessels coming from Alexandria--the island revolts.To stop the epidemic, the Ottoman sultan Abdul Hamid II sends his most accomplished quarantine expert to the island--an Orthodox Christian. Some of the Muslims, including followers of a popular religious sect and its leader Sheikh Hamdullah, refuse to take precautions or respect the quarantine. And then a murder occurs.As the plague continues its rapid spread, the Sultan sends a second doctor to the island, this time a Muslim, and strict quarantine measures are declared. But the incompetence of the island's governor and local administration and the people's refusal to respect the bans doom the quarantine to failure, and the death count continues to rise. Faced with the danger that the plague might spread to the West and to Istanbul, the Sultan bows to international pressure and allows foreign and Ottoman warships to blockade the island. Now the people of Mingheria are on their own, and they must find a way to defeat the plague themselves.Steeped in history and rife with suspense, Nights of Plague is an epic story set more than one hundred years ago, with themes that feel remarkably contemporary.","['Turkish', 'Roman', 'Mystery', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Turkish Literature', 'Literature', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1645391742i/60097027.jpg,0525656898,9780525656890,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60097027-nights-of-plague,683.0,3.57,756.0,Nights of Plague,4802.0
Matthew Salesses,English," A groundbreaking resource for fiction writers, teachers, and students, this manifesto and practical guide challenges current models of craft and the writing workshop by showing how they fail marginalized writers, and how cultural expectations inform storytelling.  The traditional writing workshop was established with white male writers in mind; what we call craft is informed by their cultural values. In this bold and original examination of elements of writingincluding plot, character, conflict, structure, and believabilityand aspects of workshopincluding the silenced writer and the imagined readerMatthew Salesses asks questions to invigorate these familiar concepts. He upends Western notions of how a story must progress. How can we rethink craft, and the teaching of it, to better reach writers with diverse backgrounds? How can we invite diverse storytelling traditions into literary spaces?Drawing from examples including One Thousand and One Nights, Curious George, Ursula K. Le Guin's A Wizard of Earthsea, and the Asian American classic No-No Boy, Salesses asks us to reimagine craft and the workshop. In the pages of exercises included here, teachers will find suggestions for building syllabi, grading, and introducing new methods to the classroom; students will find revision and editing guidance, as well as a new lens for reading their work. Salesses shows that we need to interrogate the lack of diversity at the core of published fiction: how we teach and write it.

Carissa Vliz,English,"As the data economy grows in power, Carissa Vliz exposes how our privacy is eroded by big tech and governments, why that matters and what we can do about it. The moment you check your phone in the morning you are giving away your data. Before youve even switched off your alarm, a whole host of organisations have been alerted to when you woke up, where you slept, and with whom. As you check the weather, scroll through your suggested friends on Facebook, you continually compromise your privacy. Without your permission, or even your awareness, tech companies are harvesting your information, your location, your likes, your habits, and sharing it amongst themselves. They're not just selling your data. Theyre selling the power to influence you. Even when youve explicitly asked them not to. And it's not just you. It's all your contacts too. Digital technology is stealing our personal data and with it our power to make free choices. To reclaim that power and democracy, we must protect our privacy. What can we do? So much is at stake. Our phones, our TVs, even our washing machines are spies in our own homes. We need new regulation. We need to pressure policy-makers for red lines on the data economy.

Sixteen-year-old Padma sparked and burned. Fourteen-year-old Lalli was an incorrigible romantic.They grew up in Katra Sadatganj, an eye-blink of a village in western Uttar Pradesh crammed into less than one square mile of land. It was out in the fields, in the middle of mango season, that the rumors started.Then one night in the summer of 2014 the girls went missing; and hours later they were found hanging in the orchard. Who they were, and what had happened to them, was already less important than what their disappearance meant to the people left behind.In the ensuing months, the investigation into their deaths would implode everything that their small community held to be true, and instigate a national conversation about sex and violence.

"Marc Lamont Hill, Mitchell Plitnick",English,"A bold call for the American Left to extend their politics to the issues of Israel-Palestine, from a New York Times bestselling author and an expert on U.S. policy in the regionIn this major work of daring criticism and analysis, scholar and political commentator Marc Lamont Hill and Israel-Palestine expert Mitchell Plitnick spotlight how holding fast to one-sided and unwaveringly pro-Israel policies reflects the truth-bending grip of authoritarianism on both Israel and the United States. Except for Palestine deftly argues that progressives and liberals who oppose regressive policies on immigration, racial justice, gender equality, LGBTQ rights, and other issues must extend these core principles to the oppression of Palestinians. In doing so, the authors take seriously the political concerns and well-being of both Israelis and Palestinians, demonstrating the extent to which U.S. policy has made peace harder to attain. They also unravel the conflation of advocacy for Palestinian rights with anti-Semitism and hatred of Israel.Hill and Plitnick provide a timely and essential intervention by examining multiple dimensions of the Israeli-Palestinian conversation, including Israel's growing disdain for democracy, the effects of occupation on Palestine, the siege of Gaza, diminishing American funding for Palestinian relief, and the campaign to stigmatize any critique of Israeli occupation. Except for Palestine is a searing polemic and a cri de coeur for elected officials, activists, and everyday citizens alike to align their beliefs and politics with their values.","['History', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Social Justice', 'War', 'Education', 'Race', 'Religion', 'Activism', 'Nonfiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1608047400i/53496557.jpg,1620975920,9781620975923,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53496557-except-for-palestine,227.0,4.21,454.0,Except for Palestine: The Limits of Progressive Politics,2777.0

Rod Dreher,English,"The New York Times bestselling author of The Benedict Option draws on the wisdom of Christian survivors of Soviet persecution to warn American Christians of approaching dangers.For years, migrs from the former Soviet bloc have been telling Rod Dreher they see telltale signs of ""soft"" totalitarianism cropping up in Americasomething more Brave New World than Nineteen Eighty-Four. Identity politics are beginning to encroach on every aspect of life. Civil liberties are increasingly seen as a threat to ""safety"". Progressives marginalize conservative, traditional Christians, and other dissenters. Technology and consumerism hasten the possibility of a corporate surveillance state. And the pandemic, having put millions out of work, leaves our country especially vulnerable to demagogic manipulation.In Live Not By Lies, Dreher amplifies the alarm sounded by the brave men and women who fought totalitarianism. He explains how the totalitarianism facing us today is based less on overt violence and more on psychological manipulation. He tells the stories of modern-day dissidents--clergy, laity, martyrs, and confessors from the Soviet Union and the captive nations of Europe--who offer practical advice for how to identify and resist totalitarianism in our time. Following the model offered by a prophetic World War II-era pastor who prepared believers in his Eastern European to endure the coming of communism, Live Not By Lies teaches American Christians a method for resistance:  - SEE: Acknowledge the reality of the situation. - JUDGE: Assess reality in the light of what we as Christians know to be true. - ACT: Take action to protect truth.Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn famously said that one of the biggest mistakes people make is assuming totalitarianism can't happen in their country. Many American Christians are making that mistake today, sleepwalking through the erosion of our freedoms. Live Not By Lies will wake them and equip them for the long resistance.","['History', 'Politics', 'Cultural', 'Christianity', 'Theology', 'Philosophy', 'Christian Living', 'Nonfiction', 'Faith', 'Christian']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1590441305i/53438190.jpg,0593087399,9780593087398,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53438190-live-not-by-lies,240.0,4.36,1112.0,Live Not by Lies: A Manual for Christian Dissidents,6224.0

Why are women and girls pathologized for being angry about oppression and abuse? How have so many women been duped into believing that they are mentally ill, for having normal and natural reactions to their experiences?

David  French,English,"David French warns of the potential dangers to the countryand the worldif we dont summon the courage to reconcile our political differences.Two decades into the 21st Century, the U.S. is less united than at any time in our history since the Civil War. We are more diverse in our beliefs and culture than ever before. But red and blue states, secular and religious groups, liberal and conservative idealists, and Republican and Democratic representatives all have one thing in each believes their distinct cultures and liberties are being threatened by an escalating violent opposition. This polarized tribalism, espoused by the loudest, angriest fringe extremists on both the left and the right, dismisses dialogue as appeasement; if left unchecked, it could very well lead to secession.An engaging mix of cutting edge research and fair-minded analysis, Divided We Fall is an unblinking look at the true dimensions and dangers of this widening ideological gap, and what could happen if we don't take steps toward bridging it. French reveals chilling, plausible scenarios of how the United States could fracture into regions that will not only weaken the country but destabilize the world.But our future is not written in stone. By implementing James Madisons vision of pluralismthat all people have the right to form communities representing their personal valueswe can prevent oppressive factions from seizing absolute power and instead maintain everyone s beliefs and identities across all fifty states.Reestablishing national unity will require the bravery to commit ourselves to embracing qualities of kindness, decency, and grace towards those we disagree with ideologically. French calls on all of us to demonstrate true tolerance so we can heal the American divide.

"Rozenn Morgat, Gulbahar Haitiwaji, Edward Gauvin",English,"The first and only memoir about the reeducation camps by a Uyghur woman. I have written what I lived. The atrocious reality. Gulbahar Haitiwaji to Paris MatchSince 2017, more than one million Uyghurs have been deported from their homes in the Xinjiang region of China to reeducation camps. The brutal repression of the Uyghurs, a Turkish-speaking Muslim ethnic group, has been denounced as genocide, and reported widely in media around the world. The Xinjiang Papers, revealed by the New York Times in 2019, expose the brutal repression of the Uyghur ethnicity by means of forced mass detentionthe biggest since the time of Mao. Her name is Gulbahar Haitiwaji and she is the first Uyghur woman to escape from these camps who has dared to speak out. For three years Haitiwaji endured hundreds of hours of interrogations, torture, hunger, police violence, brainwashing, forced sterilization, freezing cold, rats, and nights under blinding neon light in her prison cell. These camps are to China what the Gulags were to the USSR. The Chinese government denies that they are concentration camps, seeking to legitimize their existence in the name of the total fight against Islamic terrorism, infiltration and separatism, and calls them schools. But none of this is true. Gulbahar only escaped thanks to the relentless efforts of her daughter. Her courageous memoir is a terrifying portrait of the atrocities she endured in the Chinese gulag and how the treatment of the Uyghurs at the hands of the Chinese government is just the latest example of their oppression of independent minorities within Chinese borders. The Xinjiang region where the Uyghurs live is where the Chinese government wishes there to be a new silk route, connecting Asia to Europe, considered to be the most important political project of president Xi Jinping.","['History', 'Asian Literature', 'Politics', 'China', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir', 'Reportage', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Asia']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1638554649i/59747897.jpg,1644211483,9781644211489,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59747897-how-i-survived-a-chinese-reeducation-camp,240.0,4.15,198.0,"How I Survived a Chinese ""Reeducation"" Camp: A Uyghur Woman's Story",1350.0

Rachel Maddow,English,"Rachel Maddow traces the fight to preserve American democracy back to World War II, when a handful of committed public servants and brave private citizens thwarted far-right plotters trying to steer our nation toward an alliance with the Nazis.Inspired by her research for the hit podcast Ultra, Rachel Maddow charts the rise of a wild American strain of authoritarianism that has been alive on the far-right edge of our politics for the better part of a century. Before and even after our troops had begun fighting abroad in World War II, a clandestine network flooded the country with disinformation aimed at sapping the strength of the U.S. war effort and persuading Americans that our natural alliance waswiththe Axis, not against it. It was a sophisticated and shockingly well-funded campaign to undermine democratic institutions, promote antisemitism, and destroy citizens confidence in their elected leaders, with the ultimate goal of overthrowing the U.S. government and installing authoritarian rule.That effort workedtongue and groovealongside an ultra-right paramilitary movement that stockpiled bombs and weapons and trained for mass murder and violent insurrection.At the same time, a handful of extraordinary activists and journalists were tracking the scheme, exposing it even as it was unfolding. In 1941 the U.S. Department of Justice finally made a frontal attack, identifying the key plotters, finding their backers, and prosecuting dozens in federal court.None of it went as planned.While the scheme has been remembered in historyif at allas the work of fringe players, in reality, it involved alarge number of some of the countrys most influential elected officials. Their interference in law enforcement efforts against the plot is a dark story of the rule of law bending and then breaking under the weight of political intimidation.That failure of the legal system had consequences. The tentacles of that unslain beast have reached forward into our history for decades. But the heroic efforts of the activists, journalists, prosecutors, and regular citizens who sought to expose the insurrectionists also make for a deeply resonant, deeply relevant tale in our own disquieting times.","['Crime', 'History', 'World War II', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'War', 'True Crime', 'American History', 'Nonfiction', 'Historical']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1690852680i/168677579.jpg,0593444515,9780593444511,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/168677579-prequel,416.0,4.47,1096.0,Prequel: An American Fight Against Fascism,8129.0

This is why we resist efforts to change, often until they feel completely futile.

Nina Siegal,English,"A riveting look at the story of World War II and the Holocaust through the diaries of Dutch citizens, firsthand accounts of ordinary people living through extraordinary times Based on select writings from a collection of more than two thousand Dutch diaries written during World War II in order to record this unparalleled time, and maintained by devoted archivists, The Diary Keepers illuminates a part of history we havent seen in quite this way before, from the stories of a Nazi sympathizing police officer to a Jewish journalist who documented daily activities at a transport camp. Journalist Nina Siegal, who grew up in a family that had survived the Holocaust in Europe, had always wondered about the experience of regular people during World War II.She had heard stories of the war as a child and Anne Franks diary, but the tales were either crafted as moral lessons  to never waste food, to be grateful for all you receive, to hide your silver  or told with a punch line. The details of the past went untold in an effort to make it easier assimilate into American life. When Siegal moved to Amsterdam as an adult, those questions came up again, as did another horrifying Why did seventy five percent of the Dutch Jewish community perish in the war, while in other Western European countries the proportions were significantly lower? How did this square with the narratives of Dutch resistance she had heard so much about and in what way did it relate to the famed tolerance people in the Netherlands were always talking about? Perhaps more importantly, how could she raise a Jewish child in this country without knowing these answers? Searching and singular, The Diary Keepers mines the diaries of ordinary citizens to understand the nature of resistance, the workings of memory, and the ways we reflect on, commemorate, and re-envision the past.","['Jewish', 'History', 'World War II', 'War', 'Memoir', 'Diary', 'Holocaust', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Historical']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1675640532i/61193963.jpg,0063070650,9780063070653,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61193963-the-diary-keepers,544.0,4.36,67.0,"The Diary Keepers: World War II in the Netherlands, as Written by the People Who Lived Through It",416.0

Kathleen Stock,English,"Material Girls presents a timely and opinionated critique of the culturally influential theory that we each have an inner feeling about our sex called a gender identity, and that this feeling is more socially significant than our actual biological sex. It makes a clear and humane feminist case for retaining the ability to discuss material reality about biological sex in a range of important contexts, including female-only spaces and resources, healthcare, epidemiology, political organization and data collection. It investigates the intellectual history of gender identity, showing how the concept is linked to a misguided philosophical picture which broadly rejects science and conflates facts about intersex people with facts about trans people. Material Girls concludes with a positive vision for the future, of collaboration between feminists and trans activists, detailing how they could work together to achieve some of their political aims.","['Gender', 'Womens', 'Politics', 'Psychology', 'LGBT', 'Sociology', 'Feminism', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1610050700i/54646323.jpg,0349726590,9780349726595,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54646323-material-girls,432.0,4.21,296.0,Material Girls: Why Reality Matters for Feminism,1851.0

Mikel Jollett,English,"HOLLYWOOD PARK is a remarkable memoir of a tumultuous life. Mikel Jollett was born into one of the countrys most infamous cults, and subjected to a childhood filled with poverty, addiction, and emotional abuse. Yet, ultimately, his is a story of fierce love and family loyalty told in a raw, poetic voice that signals the emergence of a uniquely gifted writer.We were never young. We were just too afraid of ourselves. No one told us who we were or what we were or where all our parents went. They would arrive like ghosts, visiting us for a morning, an afternoon. They would sit with us or walk around the grounds, to laugh or cry or toss us in the air while we screamed. Then theyd disappear again, for weeks, for months, for years, leaving us alone with our memories and dreams, our questions and confusion. So begins Hollywood Park, Mikel Jolletts remarkable memoir. His story opens in an experimental commune in California, which later morphed into the Church of Synanon, one of the countrys most infamous and dangerous cults. Per the leaders mandate, all children, including Jollett and his older brother, were separated from their parents when they were six months old, and handed over to the cults School. After spending years in what was essentially an orphanage, Mikel escaped the cult one morning with his mother and older brother. But in many ways, life outside Synanon was even harder and more erratic.In his raw, poetic and powerful voice, Jollett portrays a childhood filled with abject poverty, trauma, emotional abuse, delinquency and the lure of drugs and alcohol. Raised by a clinically depressed mother, tormented by his angry older brother, subjected to the unpredictability of troubled step-fathers and longing for contact with his father, a former heroin addict and ex-con, Jollett slowly, often painfully, builds a life that leads him to Stanford University and, eventually, to finding his voice as a writer and musician.Hollywood Park is told at first through the limited perspective of a child, and then broadens as Jollett begins to understand the world around him. Although Mikel Jolletts story is filled with heartbreak, it is ultimately an unforgettable portrayal of love at its fiercest and most loyal.","['Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir', 'Music', 'Religion', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Autobiography', 'Cults', 'Adult']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1601570535i/49235526.jpg,1250621569,9781250621566,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49235526-hollywood-park,384.0,4.29,2325.0,Hollywood Park,15146.0

  This warm, wise, highly entertaining twenty-first century love story is about what happens when the person who makes you happiest is someone you never expected
Lucy used to handle her adult romantic life according to the script she'd been handed. She met a guy just like herself: same age, same background, same hopes and dreams; they got married and started a family. Too bad he made her miserable. Now, two decades later, she's a nearly-divorced, forty-one-year-old schoolteacher with two school-aged sons, and there is no script anymore. So when she meets Joseph, she isn't exactly looking for love--she's more in the market for a babysitter. Joseph is twenty-two, living at home with his mother, and working several jobs, including the butcher counter where he and Lucy meet. It's not a match anyone one could have predicted. He's of a different class, a different culture, and a different generation. But sometimes it turns out that the person who can make you happiest is the one you least expect, though it can take some maneuvering to see it through. Just Like You is a brilliantly observed, tender, but also brutally funny new novel that gets to the heart of what it means to fall surprisingly and headlong in love with the best possible person--someone you didn't see coming.","['Novels', 'Audiobook', 'Romance', 'British Literature', 'Literary Fiction', 'Chick Lit', 'Adult Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Fiction', 'Adult']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1586237692i/51152433.jpg,0593191382,9780593191385,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51152433-just-like-you,368.0,3.37,2466.0,Just Like You,22010.0

Rick Rubin,English,"From the legendary music producer, a master at helping people connect with the wellsprings of their creativity, comes a beautifully crafted book many years in the making that offers that same deep wisdom to all of us. ""A gorgeous and inspiring work of art on creation, creativity, the work of the artist. It will gladden the hearts of writers and artists everywhere, and get them working again with a new sense of meaning and direction. A stunning accomplishment."" --Anne Lamott""I set out to write a book about what to do to make a great work of art. Instead, it revealed itself to be a book on how to be."" --Rick RubinMany famed music producers are known for a particular sound that has its day. Rick Rubin is known for something else: creating a space where artists of all different genres and traditions can home in on who they really are and what they really offer. He has made a practice of helping people transcend their self-imposed expectations in order to reconnect with a state of innocence from which the surprising becomes inevitable. Over the years, as he has thought deeply about where creativity comes from and where it doesn't, he has learned that being an artist isn't about your specific output, it's about your relationship to the world. Creativity has a place in everyone's life, and everyone can make that place larger. In fact, there are few more important responsibilities.The Creative Act is a beautiful and generous course of study that illuminates the path of the artist as a road we all can follow. It distills the wisdom gleaned from a lifetime's work into a luminous reading experience that puts the power to create moments--and lifetimes--of exhilaration and transcendence within closer reach for all of us.","['Writing', 'Self Help', 'Audiobook', 'Psychology', 'Music', 'Design', 'Philosophy', 'Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Art']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1663707011i/60965426.jpg,0593652886,9780593652886,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60965426-the-creative-act,406.0,4.08,3756.0,The Creative Act: A Way of Being,32813.0
Luke Epplin,English,"The riveting story of four menLarry Doby, Bill Veeck, Bob Feller, and Satchel Paigewhose improbable union on the Cleveland Indians in the late 1940s would shape the immediate postwar era of Major League Baseball and beyond.
  
In July 1947, not even three months after Jackie Robinson debuted on the Brooklyn Dodgers, snapping the color line that had segregated Major League Baseball, Larry Doby would follow in his footsteps on the Cleveland Indians. Though Doby, as the second Black player in the majors, would struggle during his first summer in Cleveland, his subsequent turnaround in 1948 from benchwarmer to superstar sparked one of the wildest and most meaningful seasons in baseball history.In intimate, absorbing detail, Our Team traces the story of the integration of the Cleveland Indians and their quest for a World Series title through four key participants: Bill Veeck, an eccentric and visionary owner adept at exploding fireworks on and off the field; Larry Doby, a soft-spoken, hard-hitting pioneer whose major-league breakthrough shattered stereotypes that so much of white America held about Black ballplayers; Bob Feller, a pitching prodigy from the Iowa cornfields who set the template for the athlete as businessman; and Satchel Paige, a legendary pitcher from the Negro Leagues whose belated entry into the majors whipped baseball fans across the country into a frenzy.Together, as the backbone of a team that epitomized the postwar American spirit in all its hopes and contradictions, these four men would captivate the nation by storming to the World Series--all the while rewriting the rules of what was possible in sports.","['History', 'Baseball', 'Sports', 'Audiobook', 'Race', 'Biography', 'African American', 'American History', 'Nonfiction', 'Historical']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1572994741i/51182635.jpg,1250313791,9781250313799,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51182635-our-team,389.0,4.47,216.0,Our Team: The Epic Story of Four Men and the World Series That Changed Baseball,1206.0

Curtis White,English,"Acclaimed cultural critic Curtis White examines current fissures in Western Buddhism and argues against the growth of scientific and corporate dharma, particularly in Stephen Batchelor's Secular Buddhist movement.In Transcendent, celebrated cultural critic Curtis White, asks what Buddhism will look like in the future. Do we want a secular Buddhism that looks like corporations and neuroscience? Or do we want a Buddhismthat still provides refuge from the debased world of money and things? Transcendence is not about magic realms where spirits fly about; the world is, as Shunryu Suzuki put it, its own magic. We only need toreclaim it and reclaim our humanity while were at it.The problem White suggests is a culture that recognizes only ""things,"" capitalist things and science things, and aggressively denies the idea that the world of things has a beyond. We're told by science ideologues like the New Atheists that we live in a secular age and that philosophy is dead, and art is only an amusement, and transcendence is not wanted because science can provide all the wonder and beauty we need.Transcendent is a call for the re-enchantment not only of Buddhism but also of our Western art traditions. White recalls the risks and the raptures of the English Romantics, Beat poets, and the children of the counterculture, all in the name of a living world, and in defiance of our current world of climate catastrophe, contagious disease, and social collapse.",,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1672890911i/75585230.jpg,1612199941,9781612199948,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75585230-transcendent,211.0,3.5,11.0,Transcendent: Art and Dharma in a Time of Collapse,18.0

Juno  Dawson,English,"If you look hard enough at old photographs, we're there in the background: healers in the trenches; Suffragettes; Bletchley Park oracles; land girls and resistance fighters. Why is it we help in times of crisis? We have a gift. We are stronger than Mundanes, plain and simple.At the dawn of their adolescence, on the eve of the summer solstice, four young girls--Helena, Leonie, Niamh and Elle--took the oath to join Her Majesty's Royal Coven, established by Queen Elizabeth I as a covert government department. Now, decades later, the witch community is still reeling from a civil war and Helena is now the reigning High Priestess of the organization. Yet Helena is the only one of her friend group still enmeshed in the stale bureaucracy of HMRC. Elle is trying to pretend she's a normal housewife, and Niamh has become a country vet, using her powers to heal sick animals. In what Helena perceives as the deepest betrayal, Leonie has defected to start her own more inclusive and intersectional coven, Diaspora. And now Helena has a bigger problem. A young warlock of extraordinary capabilities has been captured by authorities and seems to threaten the very existence of HMRC. With conflicting beliefs over the best course of action, the four friends must decide where their loyalties lie: with preserving tradition, or doing what is right.Juno Dawson explores gender and the corrupting nature of power in a delightful and provocative story of magic and matriarchy, friendship and feminism. Dealing with all the aspects of contemporary womanhood, as well as being phenomenally powerful witches, Niamh, Helena, Leonie and Elle may have grown apart but they will always be bound by the sisterhood of the coven.","['Paranormal', 'Audiobook', 'Queer', 'Magic', 'LGBT', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Adult', 'Witches', 'Urban Fantasy']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1653942624i/59088433.jpg,014313714X,9780143137146,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59088433-her-majesty-s-royal-coven,448.0,3.85,3591.0,Her Majesty's Royal Coven,21694.0

"Helen Pluckrose, James   Lindsay",English,"Have you heard that language is violence and that science is sexist? Have you read that certain people shouldnt practice yoga or cook Chinese food? Or been told that being obese is healthy, that there is no such thing as biological sex, or that only white people can be racist? Are you confused by these ideas, and do you wonder how they have managed so quickly to challenge the very logic of Western society? In this probing and intrepid volume, Helen Pluckrose and James Lindsay document the evolution of the dogma that informs these ideas, from its coarse origins in French postmodernism to its refinement within activist academic fields.Today this dogma is recognizable as much by its effects, such as cancel culture and social-media dogpiles, as by its tenets, which are all too often embraced as axiomatic in mainstream media: knowledge is a social construct; science and reason are tools of oppression; all human interactions are sites of oppressive power play; and language is dangerous. As Pluckrose and Lindsay warn, the unchecked proliferation of these anti-Enlightenment beliefs present a threat not only to liberal democracy but also to modernity itself. While acknowledging the need to challenge the complacency of those who think a just society has been fully achieved, Pluckrose and Lindsay break down how this often-radical activist scholarship does far more harm than good, not least to those marginalized communities it claims to champion. They also detail its alarmingly inconsistent and illiberal ethics. Only through a proper understanding of the evolution of these ideas, they conclude, can those who value science, reason, and consistently liberal ethics successfully challenge this harmful and authoritarian orthodoxyin the academy, in culture, and beyond.","['History', 'Cultural', 'Politics', 'Psychology', 'Education', 'Sociology', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Society', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1582386609i/53052177.jpg,1634312023,9781634312028,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53052177-cynical-theories,348.0,4.12,918.0,"Cynical Theories: How Activist Scholarship Made Everything about Race, Gender, and Identity—and Why This Harms Everybody",5282.0

Natalie Haynes,English,"The Greek myths are one of the most important cultural foundation-stones of the modern world.Stories of gods and monsters are the mainstay of epic poetry and Greek tragedy, from Homer to Virgil to from Aeschylus to Sophocles and Euripides. And still, today, a wealth of novels, plays and films draw their inspiration from stories first told almost three thousand years ago. But modern tellers of Greek myth have usually been men, and have routinely shown little interest in telling womens stories.Now, in Pandoras Jar, Natalie Haynes  broadcaster, writer and passionate classicist  redresses this imbalance. Taking Greek creation myths as her starting point and then retelling the four great mythic sagas: the Trojan War, the Royal House of Thebes, Jason and the Argonauts, Heracles, she puts the female characters on equal footing with their menfolk. The result is a vivid and powerful account of the deeds  and misdeeds - of Hera, Aphrodite, Athene and Circe. And away from the goddesses of Mount Olympus it is Helen, Clytemnestra, Jocasta, Antigone and Medea who sing from these pages, not Paris, Agamemnon, Orestes or Jason.","['History', 'Short Stories', 'Audiobook', 'Nonfiction', 'Feminism', 'Mythology', 'Classics', 'Greek Mythology', 'Retellings', 'Historical']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1696265263i/51135393.jpg,1509873112,9781509873111,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51135393-pandora-s-jar,320.0,4.24,2636.0,Pandora's Jar: Women in the Greek Myths,19364.0

Ahmad is a jinni, a restless creature of fire, once free to roam the desert but now imprisoned in the shape of a man. Fearing they'll be exposed as monsters, these magical beings hide their true selves and try to pass as human--just two more immigrants in the bustling world of 1900s Manhattan. Brought together under calamitous circumstances, their lives are now entwined--but they're not yet certain of what they mean to each other.Both Chava and Ahmad have changed the lives of the people around them. Park Avenue heiress Sophia Winston, whose brief encounter with Ahmad left her with a strange illness that makes her shiver with cold, travels to the Middle East to seek a cure. There she meets Dima, a tempestuous female jinni who's been banished from her tribe. Back in New York, in a tenement on the Lower East Side, a little girl named Kreindel helps her rabbi father build a golem they name Yossele--not knowing that she's about to be sent to an orphanage uptown, where the hulking Yossele will become her only friend and protector.Spanning the tumultuous years from the turn of the twentieth century to the beginning of World War I, The Hidden Palace follows these lives and others as they collide and interleave.

Patricia MacCormack,English,"We are in the midst of a growing ecological crisis.

An alternative to posthuman thought, the term paves the way for thinking that doesn't dissolve into nihilism and despair, but actively embraces issues like human extinction, vegan abolition, atheist occultism, death studies, a refusal of identity politics, deep ecology, and the apocalypse as an optimistic beginning.In order to suggest vitalistic, perhaps even optimistic, ways to negotiate some of the difficulties in thinking and acting in the world, this book explores five key contemporary themes: Identity Spirituality Art Death The apocalypseCollapsing activism, artistic practice and affirmative ethics, while introducing some radical contemporary ideas and addressing specifically modern phenomena like death cults, intersectional identity politics and capitalist enslavement of human and nonhuman organisms to the point of 'zombiedom', The Ahuman Manifesto navigates the ways in which we must compose the human differently, specifically beyond nihilism and post- and trans-humanism and outside human privilege.

Maggie Haberman,English,"From the Pulitzer-Prize-winning New York Times reporter who has defined Donald J. Trump's presidency like no other journalist: a magnificent and disturbing reckoning that moves beyond simplistic caricature, chronicling his rise in New York City to his tortured post-presidency and his potential comeback.Few journalists working today have covered Donald Trump more extensively than Maggie Haberman. And few understand him and his motivations better. Now, demonstrating her majestic command of this story, Haberman reveals in full the depth of her understanding of the 45th president himself, and of what the Trump phenomenon means.Interviews with hundreds of sources and numerous interviews over the years with Trump himself portray a complicated and often contradictory historical figure. Capable of kindness but relying on casual cruelty as it suits his purposes. Pugnacious. Insecure. Lonely. Vindictive. Menacing. Smarter than his critics contend and colder and more calculating than his allies believe. A man who embedded himself in popular culture, galvanizing support for a run for high office that he began preliminary spadework for 30 years ago, to ultimately become a president who pushed American democracy to the brink.The through-line of Trumps life and his presidency is the enduring question of what is in it for him or what he needs to say to survive short increments of time in the pursuit of his own interests. Confidence Man is also, inevitably, about the world that produced such a singular character, giving rise to his career and becoming his first stage. It is also about a series of relentlessly transactional relationships. The ones that shaped him most were with girlfriends and wives, with Roy Cohn, with George Steinbrenner, with Mike Tyson and Don King and Roger Stone, with city and state politicians like Robert Morgenthau and Rudy Giuliani, with business partners, with prosecutors, with the media, and with the employees who toiled inside what they commonly called amongst themselves the Trump Disorganization. That world informed the one that Trump tried to recreate while in the White House. All of Trumps behavior as President had echoes in what came before. In this revelatory and newsmaking book, Haberman brings together the events of his life into a single mesmerizing work. It is the definitive account of one of the most norms-shattering and consequential eras in American political history.","['Crime', 'History', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Presidents', 'Biography', 'American History', 'Nonfiction', 'Journalism']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1644523178i/60387898.jpg,0593297342,9780593297346,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60387898-confidence-man,597.0,4.09,1066.0,Confidence Man: The Making of Donald Trump and the Breaking of America,9192.0
Henry Louis Gates Jr.,English,"From the New York Times-bestselling author of Stony the Road and one of our most important voices on the African-American experience, a powerful new history of the Black church in America as the Black community's abiding rock and its fortress.The companion book to the upcoming PBS series.For the young Henry Louis Gates, Jr., growing up in a small, segregated West Virginia town, the church was his family and his community's true center of gravity. Within those walls, voices were lifted up in song to call forth the best in each other, and to comfort each other when times were at their worst. In this book, his tender and magisterial reckoning with the meaning of the Black church in American history, Gates takes us from his own experience onto a journey across more than four hundred years and spanning the entire country. At road's end, we emerge with a new understanding of the centrality of the Black church to the American story--as a cultural and political force, as the center of resistance to slavery and white supremacy, as an unparalleled incubator of talent, and as a crucible for working through the community's most important issues, down to today.In a country that has historically afforded its citizens from the African diaspora tragically few safe spaces, the Black church has always been more than a sanctuary; it's been a place to nourish the deepest human needs and dreams of the African-American community. This fact was never lost on white supremacists: from the earliest days of slavery, when enslaved people were allowed to worship at all, their meeting houses were subject to surveillance, and often destruction. So it continued, long after slavery's formal eradication; church burnings and church bombings by the Ku Klux Klan and others have always been a hallmark of the violent effort to suppress the struggle for equality for the African-American community. The past often isn't even past--Dylann Roof committed his slaughter in Charleston's Emanuel AME Church 193 years after the church was first burned down by whites following a thwarted slave rebellion.But as Gates brilliantly shows, the Black church has never been only one thing. Its story lies at the vital center of the civil rights movement, and produced many of its leaders, from the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. on, but at the same time there have always been churches and sects that eschewed a more activist stance, even eschewed worldly political engagement altogether. That tension can be felt all the way to the Black Lives Matter movement and the work of today. Still and all, as a source of strength and a force for change, the Black church is at the center of the action at every stage of the American story, as this enthralling history makes vividly clear.","['History', 'Politics', 'Christianity', 'Social Justice', 'Theology', 'Race', 'Religion', 'American History', 'Nonfiction', 'Christian']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1608056569i/55513324.jpg,1984880330,9781984880338,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55513324-the-black-church,320.0,4.08,196.0,"The Black Church: This Is Our Story, This Is Our Song",1095.0

Annie  Hartnett,English,"A lost young woman returns to small-town New Hampshire under the strangest of circumstances in this one-of-a-kind novel of life, death, and whatever comes after from the acclaimed author of Rabbit Cake. The Starlings live in Everton, an ordinary enough New Hampshire town. It's notable only for Corbin Park, an enormous hunting park, and for Maple Street Cemetery-home to many former residents of Everton. There's also the town legend that Emma Starling was born with healing hands. But Emma has never found the right use for her healing abilities, and they've been on the fritz ever since her childhood best friend, Crystal, fell prey to addiction and disappeared. No one went looking for her; the police don't spend much time looking for drug addicts. Now Emma has come back to Everton to see her dying father, the only person who has kept up the search for Crystal. Ever since his recent diagnosis with a rare brain disease, Clive Sterling has been seeing ghosts, including Ernest Harold Baynes, the long-dead naturalist who worked in Corbin Park, and who seems to have some unfinished business in Everton. The residents of Maple Street have their own agenda, too-they'd like to see Emma live up to her potential as a miracle worker and cure her father. Emma's not exactly up for the challenge, though. Recently expelled from medical school, she takes a job as a substitute fifth-grade teacher to get back on her feet and stay close to home. As her father's condition worsens, it's all Emma can do to stay afloat. She isn't trying to be a hero-just a passable guardian to her father and her fifth-graders-but somehow she still sets in motion just the kind of miracle the town needs. Set against the backdrop of a small town in the throes of a very real opioid crisis, Unlikely Animals is a novel about familial expectations, imperfect friendships, and the possibility of resurrecting that which had been thought irrevocably lost.","['Animals', 'Audiobook', 'Magical Realism', 'Humor', 'Literary Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Contemporary', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Adult']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1648594524i/58596754.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58596754-unlikely-animals,368.0,4.09,3155.0,Unlikely Animals,17873.0

Rashid Khalidi,English,"A landmark history of one hundred years of war waged against the Palestinians from the foremost US historian of the Middle East, told through pivotal events and family historyIn 1899, Yusuf Diya al-Khalidi, mayor of Jerusalem, alarmed by the Zionist call to create a Jewish national home in Palestine, wrote a letter aimed at Theodore Herzl: the country had an indigenous people who would not easily accept their own displacement. He warned of the perils ahead, ending his note, in the name of God, let Palestine be left alone. Thus Rashid Khalidi, al-Khalidis great-great-nephew, begins this sweeping history, the first general account of the conflict told from an explicitly Palestinian perspective.Drawing on a wealth of untapped archival materials and the reports of generations of family membersmayors, judges, scholars, diplomats, and journalistsThe Hundred Years' War on Palestine upends accepted interpretations of the conflict, which tend, at best, to describe a tragic clash between two peoples with claims to the same territory. Instead, Khalidi traces a hundred years of colonial war on the Palestinians, waged first by the Zionist movement and then Israel, but backed by Britain and the United States, the great powers of the age. He highlights the key episodes in this colonial campaign, from the 1917 Balfour Declaration to the destruction of Palestine in 1948, from Israels 1982 invation of Lebanon to the endless and futile peace process. Original, authoritative, and important, The Hundred Years' War on Palestine is not a chronicle of victimization, nor does it whitewash the mistakes of Palestinian leaders or deny the emergence of national movements on both sides. In reevaluting the forces arrayed against the Palestinians, it offers an illuminating new view of a conflict that continues to this day.","['History', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'War', 'Social Justice', 'Education', 'Religion', 'Israel', 'Nonfiction', 'Historical']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1553296314i/44571967.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44571967-the-hundred-years-war-on-palestine,338.0,4.51,1909.0,"The Hundred Years' War on Palestine: A History of Settler Colonialism and Resistance, 1917–2017",12422.0

Bob Dylan,English,"The Philosophy of Modern Song is Bob Dylans first book of new writing since 2004s Chronicles: Volume Oneand since winning the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2016.Dylan, who began working on the book in 2010, offers his extraordinary insight into the nature of popular music. He writes over sixty essays focusing on songs by other artists, spanning from Stephen Foster to Elvis Costello, and in between ranging from Hank Williams to Nina Simone. He analyzes what he calls the trap of easy rhymes, breaks down how the addition of a single syllable can diminish a song, and even explains how bluegrass relates to heavy metal. These essays are written in Dylans unique prose. They are mysterious and mercurial, poignant and profound, and often laugh-out-loud funny.

Avi Steinberg,English,"A memoir about writing a novel about searching for love.Is romance dead? Is that why there are so many vampires in today's romance novels? When Avi Steinberg's love life took a grim turn, he did what he always does: He consulted his old books, the usual cast of Great (Very Serious, Usually Male) Authors. And he immediately realized that these books were part of the problem. Instead, he began to read romances, the books he--like so many of us--have been conditioned to dismiss as ""trashy."" What he discovered was a genre that was tremendously diverse and daring, along with a vast network of innovative writers who were keeping the novel as alive as ever. His own relationship problems, he realized, came down to a failure of his imagination. And so he set out on a quest to write and publish a romance novel and to find real-life love.A hybrid of memoir, travelogue, and critical essay, The Happily Ever After chronicles an adventure in a brave new world of literature. Steinberg offers a report from the trenches of romance, moving between major industry conferences and writing groups at the local bar as he works and reworks his romance novel idea. He reveals the inside scoop from a major romance publishing house, crisscrosses the country meeting mysterious ghostwriters and Fabio's great unsung rival, and offers a running take on the fascinating history of romance writing, the genre that invented, and continues to reinvent, the modern novel. Along the way he meets many readers, each of whom sheds light on why we are so fascinated by--and phobic of--romance fiction and what the vitality and fractiousness of our biggest genre says about us.With quirky wit and disarming honesty, Steinberg captures an often misunderstood literary culture and learns, from its devoted practitioners, how to take the Happily Ever After seriously in his own life.","['Writing', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir', 'Romance', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1581785462l/51788763.jpg,0385540256,9780385540254,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51788763-the-happily-ever-after,272.0,3.4,27.0,The Happily Ever After: A Memoir of an Unlikely Romance Novelist,92.0

Michael Punke,English,"The thrilling, long-awaited return of the #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Revenant.In 1866, with the country barely recovered from the Civil War, new war breaks out on the western frontier--a clash of cultures between a young, ambitious nation and the Native tribes who have lived on the land for centuries. Colonel Henry Carrington arrives in Wyoming's Powder River Valley to lead the US Army in defending the opening of a new road for gold miners and settlers. Carrington intends to build a fort in the middle of critical hunting grounds, the home of the Lakota. Red Cloud, one of the Lakota's most respected chiefs, and Crazy Horse, a young but visionary warrior, understand full well the implications of this invasion. For the Lakota, the stakes are their home, their culture, their lives.As fall bleeds into winter, Crazy Horse leads a small war party that confronts Colonel Carrington's soldiers with near constant attacks. Red Cloud, meanwhile, seeks to build the tribal alliances that he knows will be necessary to defeat the soldiers. Colonel Carrington seeks to hold together a US Army beset with internal discord. Carrington's officers are skeptical of their commander's strategy, none more so than Lieutenant George Washington Grummond, who longs to fight a foe he dismisses as inferior in all ways. The rank-and-file soldiers, meanwhile, are still divided by the residue of civil war, and tempted to desertion by the nearby goldfields.Throughout this taut saga--based on real people and events--Michael Punke brings the same immersive, vivid storytelling and historical insight that made his breakthrough debut so memorable.

From their music-filled terraces, American expatriates gaze along the coastline at the lights of Monte Carlo, where fortunes are won, lost, stolen, and sometimes hidden away. When Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes arrive, they find their partnership pulled between youthful pleasures and old sins, hot sun and cool jazz, new affections and enduring loyalties.Russell falls into easy friendship with an enthralling American couple, Sara and Gerald Murphy, whose golden life on the Riviera has begun to attract famous writers and artists--and some of the scoundrels linked with Monte Carlo's underworld. The Murphy set will go on to inspire everyone from F.

Russell is certain of Mrs. Hudson's innocence; Holmes is not.

Even if youve never watched a minute of professional wrestling, you are living in Vince McMahons world. In his four decades as the defining figure of American pro wrestling, McMahon was the man behind Dwayne The Rock Johnson, Stone Cold Steve Austin, John Cena, Dave Bautista, Bret The Hitman Hart, and Hulk Hogan, to name just a few of the mega-stars who owe him their careers. For more than twenty-five years, he has also been a performer in his own show, acting as the diabolical Mr. McMahona figure who may have more in common with the real Vince than he would care to admit. Just as importantly, McMahon is one of Donald Trumps closest friendsand Trumps experiences as a performer in McMahons programming were, in many ways, a dress rehearsal for the 45th Presidents campaigns and presidency. McMahon and his wife, Linda, are major Republican donors. Linda was in Trumps cabinet. McMahon makes deals with the Saudi government worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And for generations of people who have watched wrestling, he has been a defining cultural force. Accessible to anyone, regardless of wrestling knowledge, Ringmaster is an unauthorized, independent, investigative chronicle of Vince McMahons origins and rise to supreme power. It is built on exclusive interviews with more than 150 people, from McMahons childhood friends to those who accuse him of destroying their lives. Far more than just an athletics or entertainment biography, Ringmaster uses Vinces story as a new lens for understanding the contemporary American apocalypse.","['History', 'Sports', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'American', 'Pop Culture', 'Biography', 'Business', 'Nonfiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1677786713i/61273754.jpg,1982169443,9781982169442,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61273754-ringmaster,464.0,3.76,262.0,Ringmaster: Vince McMahon and the Unmaking of America,1586.0

Michael Leviton,English,"A memoir about one mans strange upbringing in a family fanatically devoted to honesty  Raised in what he affectionately calls our little honesty cult, Michael Leviton was ingrained with his parents core philosophy: You do not tell any lies; you do not withhold the truth; and you speak your mind always, regardless of how offensive or hurtful your opinions may be. For young Michael, this freedom to be yourselfdespite being bullied and ostracized at schoolfelt liberating. By the time Leviton was 29 years old, he had told three (what most people would consider) lies in his entire life.  But his parents enthusiasm for just being honest bordered on extreme. After Michael graduated high school and left home, truth tellingin job interviews, on dates, in social interactionsslowly lost its luster. When the only woman who ever appreciated his honesty brought this radical approach to truth into their relationship, Michael decided it was time to embrace the power of lying. To Be Honest is a quirky, tender, and wry story of a man discovering what it means and how it feels to lie in ones daily life.

Billy Collins,English,"A collection of more than 125 small poems, all of them new, each a thought or observation compressed to its emotional essence--from the former United States Poet Laureate and New York Times bestselling author of Aimless Love.Whenever I open a book of poems, I tend to flip through looking for the small ones. Just as I might have trust in an abstract expressionist painter if I knew he or she could draw a credible chicken, I trust poets who can go short. --Billy CollinsYou can spot a Billy Collins poem immediately. The amiable voice, the light touch, the sudden turn at the end. He puts the 'fun' back in profundity, says poet Alice Fulton. In his own words, his poems tend to start in Kansas and end in Oz.Now America's favorite poet (The Wall Street Journal) has found a new form for his unique poetic style: the small poem. Here Collins writes about his trademark themes of nature, animals, poetry, mortality, absurdity, and love--all in a handful of lines. Neither haiku nor limerick, the small poem pushes to an extreme poetry's famed power to condense emotional and conceptual meaning. Inspired by the small poetry of writers as diverse as William Carlos Williams, W.S. Merwin, Kay Ryan, and Charles Simic, and written with Collins's recognizable wit and wisdom, the more than 125 new poems of Musical Tables show one of our greatest poets channeling his unique voice into a new phase of his exceptional career.3:00 AMOnly my handis asleep, but it's a start.","['Literature', 'Humor', 'The United States Of America', 'Poetry', 'Nonfiction', 'Adult']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1647260105i/59900080.jpg,0399589783,9780399589782,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59900080-musical-tables,176.0,3.78,396.0,Musical Tables: Poems,1728.0

Andrew Ross,English,"An eye-opening investigation of Americas rural and suburban housing crisis, told through a searing portrait of precarious living in Disney World's backyard.Today, a minimum-wage earner can afford a one-bedroom apartment in only 145 out of 3,143 counties in America. One of the very worst places in the United States to look for affordable housing is Osceola County, Florida.Once the main approach to Disney World, where vacationers found lodging on their way to the Magic Kingdom, the fifteen-mile Route 192 corridor in Osceola has become a site of shocking contrasts. At one end, global investors snatch up foreclosed properties and park their capital in extravagant vacation homes for affluent visitors, eliminating the countys affordable housing in the process. At the other, underpaid tourist industry workers, displaced families, and disabled and elderly people subsisting on government checks cram themselves into dilapidated, roach-infested motels, or move into tent camps in the woods.Through visceral, frontline reporting from the motels and encampments dotting central Florida, renowned social analyst Andrew Ross exposes the overlooked housing crisis sweeping Americas suburbs and rural areas, where residents suffer ongoing trauma, poverty, and nihilism. As millions of renters face down evictions and foreclosures in the midst of the COVID-19 recession, Andrew Ross reveals how ineffective government planning, property market speculation, and poverty wages have combined to create this catastrophe.

Catherine Lacey,English,"From one of our fiercest stylists, a roaring epic chronicling the life, times, and secrets of a notorious artist.When Xan iconoclastic artist, writer, and polarizing shape-shifterfalls dead in her office, her widow, wild with grief and refusing everyones good advice, hurls herself into writing a biography of the woman she deified. Though X was recognized as a crucial creative force of her era, she kept a tight grip on her life story. Not even CM, her wife, knew where X had been born, and in her quest to find out, she opens a Pandoras box of secrets, betrayals, and destruction. All the while, she immerses herself in the history of the Southern Territory, a fascist theocracy that split from the rest of the country after World War II, as it is finally, in the present day, forced into an uneasy reunification. A masterfully constructed literary adventure complete with original images assembled by Xs widow, Biography of X follows a grieving wife seeking to understand the woman who enthralled her. CM traces Xs peripatetic trajectory over decades, from Europe to the ruins of America's divided territories, and through her collaborations and feuds with everyone from Bowie and Waits to Sontag and Acker. And when she finally understands the scope of Xs defining artistic project, CM realizes her wifes deceptions were far crueler than she imagined.Pulsing with suspense and intellect while blending nonfiction and fiction, Biography of X is a roaring epic that plumbs the depths of grief, art, and love. In her most ambitious novel yet, Catherine Lacey, one of our most acclaimed literary innovators, pushes her craft to its highest level, introducing us to an unforgettable character who, in her tantalizing mystery, shows us the fallibility of the stories we craft for ourselves.","['Novels', 'Audiobook', 'Queer', 'Lesbian', 'LGBT', 'Mystery', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Fiction', 'Adult']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1661091574i/61068817.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61068817-biography-of-x,416.0,3.87,1560.0,Biography of X,7586.0

Aubrey Gordon,English,"From the creator of Your Fat Friend, an explosive indictment of the systemic and cultural bias facing plus-size people that will move us toward creating an agenda for fat justice.Anti-fatness is everywhere. In What We Don't Talk About When We Talk About Fat, Aubrey Gordon unearths the cultural attitudes and social systems that have led to people being denied basic needs because they are fat and calls for social justice movements to be inclusive of plus-sized people's experiences. Unlike the recent wave of memoirs and quasi self-help books that encourage readers to love and accept themselves, Gordon pushes the discussion further towards authentic fat activism, which includes ending legal weight discrimination, giving equal access to health care for large people, increased access to public spaces, and ending anti-fat violence. As she argues, I did not come to body positivity for self-esteem. I came to it for social justice.By sharing her experiences as well as those of others--from smaller fat to very fat people--she concludes that to be fat in our society is to be seen as an undeniable failure, unlovable, unforgivable, and morally condemnable. Fatness is an open invitation for others to express disgust, fear, and insidious concern. To be fat is to be denied humanity and empathy. Studies show that fat survivors of sexual assault are less likely to be believed and less likely than their thin counterparts to report various crimes; 27% of very fat women and 13% of very fat men attempt suicide; over 50% of doctors describe their fat patients as awkward, unattractive, ugly and noncompliant; and in 48 states, it's legal--even routine--to deny employment because of an applicant's size.Advancing fat justice and changing prejudicial structures and attitudes will require work from all people. What We Don't Talk About When We Talk About Fat is a crucial tool to create a tectonic shift in the way we see, talk about, and treat our bodies, fat and thin alike.","['Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Social Justice', 'Essays', 'Memoir', 'Sociology', 'Feminism', 'Health', 'Nonfiction', 'Adult']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1589287459i/52011076.jpg,0807041300,9780807041307,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52011076-what-we-don-t-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-fat,197.0,4.42,2254.0,What We Don't Talk About When We Talk About Fat,15144.0
Bart D. Ehrman,English,"A New York Times bestselling historian of early Christianity takes on two of the most gripping questions of human existence: where did the ideas of heaven and hell come from, and why do they endure?What happens when we die? A recent Pew Research poll showed that 72% of Americans believe in a literal heaven, 58% in a literal hell. Most people who hold these beliefs are Christian and assume they are the age-old teachings of the Bible. But eternal rewards and punishments are found nowhere in the Old Testament and are not what Jesus or his disciples taught. So where did the ideas come from? In clear and compelling terms, Bart Ehrman recounts the long history of the afterlife, ranging from The Epic of Gilgamesh up to the writings of Augustine, focusing especially on the teachings of Jesus and his early followers. He discusses ancient guided tours of heaven and hell, in which a living person observes the sublime blessings of heaven for those who are saved and the horrifying torments of hell for the damned. Some of these accounts take the form of near death experiences, the oldest on record, with intriguing similarities to those reported today. One of Ehrmans startling conclusions is that there never was a single Greek, Jewish, or Christian understanding of the afterlife, but numerous competing views. Moreover, these views did not come from nowhere; they were intimately connected with the social, cultural, and historical worlds out of which they emerged. Only later, in the early Christian centuries, did they develop into the notions of eternal bliss or damnation widely accepted today. As a historian, Ehrman obviously cannot provide a definitive answer to the question of what happens after death. In Heaven and Hell, he does the next best thing: by helping us reflect on where our ideas of the afterlife come from, he assures us that even if there may be something to hope for when we die, there is certainly nothing to fear.","['History', 'Spirituality', 'Christianity', 'Audiobook', 'Theology', 'Religion', 'Philosophy', 'Anthropology', 'Nonfiction', 'Christian']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1575812957i/50793705.jpg,1501136739,9781501136733,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50793705-heaven-and-hell,327.0,4.06,457.0,Heaven and Hell: A History of the Afterlife,3147.0

I am the hurting kind. What does it mean to be the hurting kind? To be sensitive not only to the worlds pain and joys, but to the meanings that bend in the scrim between the natural world and the human world? To divine the relationships between us all?

These poems slip through the seasons, teeming with horses and kingfishers and the gleaming eyes of fish. And they honor parents, stepparents, and grandparents: the sacrifices made, the separate lives lived, the tendernesses extended to a hurting child; the abundance, in retrospect, of having two families.Along the way, we glimpse loss. There are flashes of the pandemic, ghosts whose presence manifests in unexpected memories and the mysterious behavior of pets left behind.

"Daniel Mat, Gabor Mat",English,"By the acclaimed author of In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts, a groundbreaking investigation into the causes of illness, a bracing critique of how our society breeds disease, and a pathway to health and healing.In this revolutionary book, renowned physician Gabor Mat eloquently dissects how in Western countries that pride themselves on their healthcare systems, chronic illness and general ill health are on the rise. Nearly 70 percent of Americans are on at least one prescription drug; more than half take two. In Canada, every fifth person has high blood pressure. In Europe, hypertension is diagnosed in more than 30 percent of the population. And everywhere, adolescent mental illness is on the rise. So what is really normal when it comes to health?Over four decades of clinical experience, Mat has come to recognize the prevailing understanding of normal as false, neglecting the roles that trauma and stress, and the pressures of modern-day living, exert on our bodies and our minds at the expense of good health. For all our expertise and technological sophistication, Western medicine often fails to treat the whole person, ignoring how todays culture stresses the body, burdens the immune system, and undermines emotional balance. Now Mat brings his perspective to the great untangling of common myths about what makes us sick, connects the dots between the maladies of individuals and the declining soundness of societyand offers a compassionate guide for health and healing. Co-written with his son Daniel, The Myth of Normal is Mats most ambitious and urgent book yet.","['Self Help', 'Audiobook', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Medicine', 'Sociology', 'Health', 'Nonfiction', 'Mental Health', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1647801716i/58537332.jpg,0593083881,9780593083888,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58537332-the-myth-of-normal,576.0,4.32,2056.0,"The Myth of Normal: Trauma, Illness, and Healing in a Toxic Culture",19252.0

Claire Heywood,English,"For millennia, men have told the legend of the woman whose face launched a thousand ships--but now it's time to hear her side of the story. Daughters of Sparta is a tale of secrets, love, and tragedy from the women behind mythology's most devastating war, the infamous Helen and her sister Klytemnestra.As princesses of Sparta, Helen and Klytemnestra have known nothing but luxury and plenty. With their high birth and unrivaled beauty, they are the envy of all of Greece. But such privilege comes at a cost. While still only girls, the sisters are separated and married to foreign kings of their father's choosing--the powerful Agamemnon, and his brother Menelaos. Yet even as Queens, each is only expected to do two things: birth an heir and embody the meek, demure nature that is expected of women.But when the weight of their husbands' neglect, cruelty, and ambition becomes too heavy to bear, Helen and Klytemnestra must push against the constraints of their society to carve new lives for themselves, and in doing so, make waves that will ripple throughout the next three thousand years.Daughters of Sparta is a vivid and illuminating reimagining of the Siege of Troy, told through the perspectives of two women whose voices have been ignored for far too long.Required reading for fans of Circe, and a remarkable, thrilling debut.  --Fiona Davis, New York Times bestselling author of The Lions of Fifth Avenue""[A] gorgeous retelling of the classic Greek myth...

Daisy Pitkin,English,"Riveting and intimate. It is hard to imagine a more humanizing portrait of the American labor movement. A remarkable debut. Francisco Cant, New York Times bestselling author of The Line Becomes a River  On the Line takes us inside a bold five-year campaign to bring a union to the dangerous industrial laundry factories of Phoenix, Arizona. The fight is led by two courageous women: Daisy Pitkin, a young labor organizer, and Alma, a second-shift immigrant worker who risks her livelihood fighting for safer working conditions. On the Line illuminates the harsh realities that workers in these factories faceroutine exposure to biohazardous waste, surgical tools left in hospital sheets, and overheating machineryas well as the ways broken US labor law makes it nearly impossible for them to fight back. Forged in the flames of a vicious anti-union crusade and a grueling legal battle, the relationships that grow between Daisy, Alma, and the other factory workers show how a union, at its best, can reach beyond the workplace and form a solidarity so powerful that it can transcend friendship and transform communities. But when political strife divides the union, and her bond with Alma along with it, Daisy is forced to reflect on her own position of privilege and the power imbalances inherent in any top-down organizing movement. In the social tradition of Barbara Ehrenreichs Nickel and Dimed, Stephanie Lands Maid, or Matthew Desmonds Evicted, and capturing the deeply personal nature of organizing, On the Line offers an exhilarating and long overdue look at the modern-day labor movement, how difficult it is to bring about social change, and why we cant afford to stop trying. At this moment, when interest in collective action is rising, On the Line is a vital contribution to our national conversation.","['History', 'Womens', 'Politics', 'Social Justice', 'Memoir', 'Economics', 'Feminism', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Labor']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1635267140i/58328434.jpg,1643750712,9781643750712,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58328434-on-the-line,288.0,4.27,59.0,"On the Line: A Story of Class, Solidarity, and Two Women's Epic Fight to Build a Union",320.0

The Wall Street JournalStimulating . . . encourage[s] readers to push past well-trod assumptions [] and have fun doing so.  Science MagazineFrom renowned physicist and creator of the YouTube series Science without the Gobbledygook, a book that takes a no-nonsense approach to lifes biggest questions, and wrestles with what physics really says about the human conditionNot only can we not currently explain the origin of the universe, it is questionable we will ever be able to explain it. The notion that there are universes within particles, or that particles are conscious, is ascientific, as is the hypothesis that our universe is a computer simulation. On the other hand, the idea that the universe itself is conscious is difficult to rule out entirely.According to Sabine Hossenfelder, it is not a coincidence that quantum entanglement and vacuum energy have become the go-to explanations of alternative healers, or that people believe their deceased grandmother is still alive because of quantum mechanics. Science and religion have the same roots, and they still tackle some of the same Where do we come from? Where do we go to? How much can we know? The area of science that is closest to answering these questions is physics. Over the last century, physicists have learned a lot about which spiritual ideas are still compatible with the laws of nature. Not always, though, have they stayed on the scientific side of the debate.In this lively, thought-provoking book, Hossenfelder takes on the biggest questions in Does the past still exist? Do particles think? Was the universe made for us? Has physics ruled out free will? Will we ever have a theory of everything? She lays out how far physicists are on the way to answering these questions, where the current limits are, and what questions might well remain unanswerable forever. Her book offers a no-nonsense yet entertaining take on some of the toughest riddles in existence, and will give the reader a solid grasp on what we knowand what we dont know.","['Spirituality', 'Audiobook', 'Psychology', 'Mathematics', 'Popular Science', 'Religion', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Nonfiction', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1637777632i/59695048.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59695048-existential-physics,269.0,3.92,324.0,Existential Physics: A Scientist's Guide to Life's Biggest Questions,2175.0
Karen Odden,English,"In the tradition of C. S. Harris and Anne Perry, a fatal disaster on the Thames and a roiling political conflict set the stage for Karen Oddens second Inspector Corravan historical mystery.September 1878. One night, as the pleasure boat the Princess Alice makes her daily trip up the Thames, she collides with the Bywell Castle, a huge iron-hulled collier. The Princess Alice shears apart, throwing all 600 passengers into the river; only 130 survive.

Lacy Crawford,English,"A riveting, lucid memoir of a young woman's struggle to regain her sense of self after trauma, and the efforts by a powerful New England boarding school to silence her--at any costWhen the elite St. Paul's School recently came under state investigation after extensive reports of sexual abuse on campus, Lacy Crawford thought she'd put behind her the assault she'd suffered at St. Paul's decades before, when she was fifteen. Still, when detectives asked for victims to come forward, she sent a note.Her criminal case file reopened, she saw for the first time evidence that corroborated her memories. Here were depictions of the nave, hard-working girl she'd been, a chorister and debater, the daughter of a priest; of the two senior athletes who assaulted her and were allowed to graduate with awards; and of the faculty, doctors, and priests who had known about Crawford's assault and gone to great lengths to bury it.Now a wife, mother, and writer living on the other side of the country, Crawford learned that police had uncovered astonishing proof of an institutional silencing years before, and that unnamed powers were still trying to block her case. The slander, innuendo, and lack of adult concern that Crawford had experienced as a student hadn't been imagined as the effects of trauma, after all: these were the actions of a school that prized its reputation above anything, even a child.This revelation launched Crawford on an extraordinary inquiry into the ways gender, privilege, and power shaped her experience as a girl at the gates of America's elite. Her investigation looks beyond the sprawling playing fields and soaring chapel towers of crucibles of power like St. Paul's, whose reckoning is still to come. And it runs deep into the channels of shame and guilt, witness and silencing, that dictate who can speak and who is heard in American society.An insightful, mature, beautifully written memoir, Notes on a Silencing is an arresting coming-of-age story that wrestles with an essential question for our time: what telling of a survivor's story will finally force a remedy?","['Crime', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir', 'Feminism', 'Biography', 'True Crime', 'Nonfiction', 'Autobiography', 'Adult']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1573675048i/48717403.jpg,0316491551,9780316491556,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48717403-notes-on-a-silencing,400.0,4.25,1302.0,Notes on a Silencing: A Memoir,8668.0

Joshua Prager,English,"Despite her famous pseudonym, Jane Roe, no one knows the truth about Norma McCorvey (19472017), whose unwanted pregnancy in 1969 opened a great fracture in American life. Journalist Joshua Prager spent hundreds of hours with Norma, discovered her personal papersa previously unseen troveand witnessed her final moments. The Family Roe presents her life in full. Propelled by the crosscurrents of sex and religion, gender and class, it is a life that tells the story of abortion in America.Prager begins that story on the banks of Louisianas Atchafalaya River where Norma was born, and where unplanned pregnancies upended generations of her forebears. A pregnancy then upended Normas life too, and the Dallas waitress became Jane Roe.Drawing on a decade of research, Prager reveals the woman behind the pseudonym, writing in novelistic detail of her unknown life from her time as a sex worker in Dallas, to her private thoughts on family and abortion, to her dealings with feminist and Christian leaders, to the three daughters she placed for adoption.Prager found those women, including the youngestBaby Roenow fifty years old. She shares her story in The Family Roe for the first time, from her tortured interactions with her birth mother, to her emotional first meeting with her sisters, to the burden that was uniquely hers from conception.The Family Roe abounds in such revelationsnot only about Norma and her children but about the broader family connected to the case. Prager tells the stories of activists and bystanders alike whose lives intertwined with Roe. In particular, he introduces three figures as important as they are unknown: feminist lawyer Linda Coffee, who filed the original Texas lawsuit yet now lives in obscurity; Curtis Boyd, a former fundamentalist Christian, today a leading provider of third-trimester abortions; and Mildred Jefferson, the first black female Harvard Medical School graduate, who became a pro-life leader with great secrets.An epic work spanning fifty years of American history, The Family Roe will change the way you think about our enduring American divide: the right to choose or the right to life.","['History', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Social Justice', 'Law', 'Feminism', 'Biography', 'American History', 'Nonfiction', 'Social Issues']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1625851298i/57356641.jpg,0393247716,9780393247718,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57356641-the-family-roe,672.0,4.12,325.0,The Family Roe: An American Story,2228.0

Jarrett Adams,English,"He was seventeen when an all-white jury sentenced him to prison for a crime he didn't commit. Now, in this unforgettable memoir, a pioneering lawyer recalls the journey that led to his exoneration--and inspired him to devote his life to fighting the many injustices in our legal system.Seventeen years old and facing nearly thirty years behind bars, Jarrett Adams sought to figure out the why behind his fate. Sustained by his mother and aunts who brought him back from the edge of despair through letters of prayer and encouragement, Adams became obsessed with our legal system in all its damaged glory. After studying how his constitutional rights to effective counsel had been violated, he solicited the help of the Wisconsin Innocence Project, an organization that exonerates the wrongfully convicted, and won his release after nearly ten years in prison.But the journey was far from over. Adams took the lessons he learned through his incarceration and worked his way through law school with the goal of helping those who, like himself, had faced our legal system at its worst. After earning his law degree, he worked with the New York Innocence Project, becoming the first exoneree ever hired by the nonprofit as a lawyer. In his first case with the Innocence Project, he argued before the same court that had convicted him a decade earlier--and won.In this cinematic story of hope and full-circle redemption, Adams draws on his life and the cases of his clients to show the racist tactics used to convict young men of color, the unique challenges facing exonerees once released, and how the lack of equal representation in our courts is a failure not only of empathy but of our collective ability to uncover the truth. Justice for Sale is an unforgettable firsthand account of the limits--and possibilities--of our country's system of law.","['Politics', 'Social Justice', 'Biography Memoir', 'Law', 'Memoir', 'Race', 'Biography', 'True Crime', 'Nonfiction', 'Autobiography']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1625598675i/54614572.jpg,0593137817,9780593137819,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54614572-redeeming-justice,304.0,4.78,104.0,"Redeeming Justice: From Defendant to Defender, My Fight for Equity on Both Sides of a Broken System",558.0

"Joannes W. M. Groenewege, Nria A",English,"""The Salon of Exiled Artists in California"" is a biography of Salka Viertel, a Jewish actress who emigrated to Hollywood and was popularly known as the screenwriter of the Swedish actress Greta Garbo. Besides, she had a salon in Santa Monica, California, which was attended by a large part of the European intelligentsia in exile. Salka was a very modern and interesting woman for her time who should be recognized as such. The book deals with topics such as Salka Viertel's alleged bisexuality and the number of friends she had, to name but a few: Albert Einstein, Charles Chaplin, Sergei Eisenstein, F. W. Murnau, Max Reinhardt, Arnold Schnberg, Thomas Mann, Bertolt Brecht, Greta Garbo, Montgomery Clift... Also, like Gertrude Stein and other notorious women, she had her literary salon through which writers like Truman Capote, Christopher Isherwood, Gore Vidal and many other writers passed. Other themes she covers are the Berlin of the 1920s; the transition from silent to spoken film, as seen from the Mecca of Hollywood. Then, the rise of Hitler and what it meant for the Jewish condition; the exile of those intellectuals who could not return to their respective countries because of the Second World War. Later, the Cold War and the witch-hunt against communism. The truth is that the background to the life of Salka Viertel and her circle of friends encompasses the great events of the 20th century. With this project, the author was awarded the Shanghai Writing Program (China, 2016) and the Baltic Centre (Sweden, 2017) residency grants.REVIEW: ""A very interesting story and I think even in these very current times since in my eyes we have not made much progress on the issue of acceptance of 'interpersonal feelings' in general. A great and extremely interesting book about Hollywood in the thirties and forties about the influence of artists from European countries such as Germany, Austria, France, Sweden, England, Ukraine and others. An extensive and high-quality research project resulting in an in-depth account of many well-known and famous personalities and their interpersonal relationships.""-Joannes W. M. Groenewege, translator.ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Nria A (Lleida, 1973) is a Catalan writer.

Five years ago, Lauren Martin was sure something was wrong with her. She had a good job in New York, an apartment in Brooklyn, a boyfriend, yet every day she wrestled with feelings of inferiority, anxiety and irritability. It wasn't until a chance encounter with a (charming, successful) stranger who revealed that she also felt these things, that Lauren set out to better understand the hold that these moods had on her, how she could change them, and began to blog about the wisdom she uncovered. It quickly exploded into an international online community of women who felt like she did: lost, depressed, moody, and desirous of change.Inspired by her audience to press even deeper, The Book of Moods shares Lauren's journey to infuse her life with a sense of peace and stability. With observations that will resonate and inspire, she dives into the universal triggers every woman faces -- whether it's a comment from your mother, the relentless grind at your job, days when you wish the mirror had a Valencia filter, or all of the above. Blending cutting-edge science, timeless philosophy, witty anecdotes and effective forms of self-care, Martin has written a powerful, intimate, and incredibly relatable chronicle of transformation, proving that you really can turn your worst moods into your best life.","['Self Help', 'Audiobook', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Memoir', 'Mental Illness', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Mental Health', 'Adult']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1586834943i/53021563.jpg,1538733625,9781538733622,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53021563-the-book-of-moods,288.0,3.83,452.0,The Book of Moods: How I Turned My Worst Emotions Into My Best Life,3880.0

Wayne Koestenbaum,English,"Toward what goal do I aspire, ever, but collision? Always accident, concussion, bodies butting together . . . By collision I also mean metaphor and metonymy: operations of slide and slip and transfuse.

A subway passengers leather bracelet prompts musings on the German word for stranger; Montaigne leads to the memory of a fourth-grade friends stinky feet. Koestenbaum dreams about a hand job from John Ashbery, swims next to Nicole Kidman, reclaims Robert Rauschenbergs squeegee, and apotheosizes Marguerite Duras as a destroyer of sentences. He directly proposes assignments to readers: Buy a one-dollar cactus, and start anthropomorphizing it. Call it Sabrina. Describe an ungenerous or unkind act you have committed. Find in every orgasm an encyclopedic richness . . . Reimagine doing the laundry as having an orgasm, and reinterpret orgasm as not a tiny experience, temporally limited, occurring in a single human body, but as an experience that somehow touches on all of human history.

Rebecca Donner,English,"Born and raised in Milwaukee, Mildred Harnack was twenty-six when she enrolled in a PhD program in Germany and witnessed the meteoric rise of the Nazi party. In 1932, she began holding secret meetings in her apartment  a small band of political activists that by 1940 had grown into the largest underground resistance group in Berlin. She recruited working-class Germans into the resistance, helped Jews escape, plotted acts of sabotage, and collaborated in writing leaflets that denounced Hitler and called for revolution. Her co-conspirators circulated through Berlin under the cover of night, slipping the leaflets into mailboxes, public restrooms, phone booths. When the first shots of the Second World War were fired, she became a spy, couriering top-secret intelligence to the Allies. On the eve of her escape to Sweden, she was ambushed by the Gestapo. At a Nazi military court, a panel of five judges sentenced her to six years at a prison camp, but Hitler overruled the decision and ordered her execution. On February 16, 1943, she was strapped to a guillotine and beheaded.Historians identify Mildred Harnack as the only American in the leadership of the German resistance, yet her remarkable story has remained almost unknown until now.Harnacks great-great-niece Rebecca Donner draws on her extensive archival research in Germany, Russia, England, and the U.S. as well as newly uncovered documents in her family archive to produce this astonishing work of narrative nonfiction. Fusing elements of biography, real-life political thriller, and scholarly detective story, Donner brilliantly interweaves letters, diary entries, notes smuggled out of a Berlin prison, survivors testimony, and a trove of declassified intelligence documents into a powerful, epic story, reconstructing the moral courage of an enigmatic woman nearly erased by history.","['History', 'World War II', 'Audiobook', 'War', 'Biography Memoir', 'Germany', 'Holocaust', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Historical']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1600086717i/53023523.jpg,031656169X,9780316561693,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53023523-all-the-frequent-troubles-of-our-days,576.0,4.31,715.0,All the Frequent Troubles of Our Days: The True Story of the American Woman at the Heart of the German Resistance to Hitler,4637.0

Samas O'Reilly,English,"A heart-warming and hilarious family memoir of growing up as one of eleven children raised by a single dad in Northern Ireland at the end of the TroublesAfter the untimely death of his mother, five-year-old Samas O'Reilly and his ten siblings were left to the care of their loving but understandably beleaguered father. In this thoroughly delightful memoir, we follow O'Reilly and the rest of his rowdy clan as they learn to cook, clean, do the laundry, and struggle (often hilariously) to keep the household running smoothly and turn into adults in the absence of the woman who had held them together. Along the way, we see O'Reilly through various adventures: There's the time the family's windows were blown out by an IRA bomb; the time a priest blessed their thirteen-seater caravan before they took off for a holiday on which they narrowly escaped death; the time O'Reilly worked as a guide in a leprechaun museum during the recession; and of course, the time he inadvertently found himself on ketamine while serving drinks to the president of Ireland. Through it all, the lovable, ginger-haired O'Reilly regales us with his combination of wit, absurdity, and tenderness, creating a charming and unforgettable portrait of an oddly gigantic family's search for some semblance of normalcy.","['Irish Literature', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir', 'Humor', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Autobiography', 'Ireland', 'Family']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1572262075i/52588525.jpg,0316424250,9780316424257,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52588525-did-ye-hear-mammy-died-a-memoir,231.0,4.13,804.0,Did Ye Hear Mammy Died?

In a land where the coal companies use violence and intimidation to keep miners from organizing, Doc Moo"" Muhanna, a Lebanese-American doctor (inspired by the authors own great-grandfather), toils amid the blood and injustice of the mining camps.

Anna Wiener,English,"The prescient, page-turning account of a journey in Silicon Valley: a defining memoir of our digital ageIn her mid-twenties, at the height of tech industry idealism, Anna Wienerstuck, broke, and looking for meaning in her work, like any good millennial--left a job in book publishing for the promise of the new digital economy. She moved from New York to San Francisco, where she landed at a big-data startup in the heart of the Silicon Valley bubble: a world of surreal extravagance, dubious success, and fresh-faced entrepreneurs hell-bent on domination, glory, and, of course, progress.Anna arrived amidst a massive cultural shift, as the tech industry rapidly transformed into a locus of wealth and power rivaling Wall Street. But amid the company ski vacations and in-office speakeasies, boyish camaraderie and ride-or-die corporate fealty, a new Silicon Valley began to emerge: one in far over its head, one that enriched itself at the expense of the idyllic future it claimed to be building.Part coming-age-story, part portrait of an already-bygone era, Anna Wieners memoir is a rare first-person glimpse into high-flying, reckless startup culture at a time of unchecked ambition, unregulated surveillance, wild fortune, and accelerating political power. With wit, candor, and heart, Anna deftly charts the tech industrys shift from self-appointed world savior to democracy-endangering liability, alongside a personal narrative of aspiration, ambivalence, and disillusionment.Unsparing and incisive, Uncanny Valley is a cautionary tale, and a revelatory interrogation of a world reckoning with consequences its unwitting designers are only beginning to understand.","['Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Technology', 'Memoir', 'Feminism', 'Biography', 'Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Autobiography', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1559568004i/45186565.jpg,0374278016,9780374278014,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45186565-uncanny-valley,281.0,3.64,3966.0,Uncanny Valley,33233.0

Kate Bowler,English,"
  The bestselling author of Everything Happens for a Reason (And Other Lies I've Loved) asks, how do you move forward with a life you didn't choose?
  
It's hard to give up on the feeling that the life you really want is just out of reach. A beach body by summer. A trip to Disneyland around the corner. A promotion on the horizon. Everyone wants to believe that they are headed toward good, better, best. But what happens when the life you hoped for is put on hold indefinitely?Kate Bowler believed that life was a series of unlimited choices, until she discovered, at age 35, that her body was wracked with cancer. In No Cure for Being Human, she searches for a way forward as she mines the wisdom (and absurdity) of today's ""best life now"" advice industry, which insists on exhausting positivity and on trying to convince us that we can out-eat, out-learn, and out-perform our humanness. We are, she finds, as fragile as the day we were born.With dry wit and unflinching honesty, Kate Bowler grapples with her diagnosis, her ambition, and her faith as she tries to come to terms with her limitations in a culture that says anything is possible. She finds that we need one another if we're going to tell the truth: Life is beautiful and terrible, full of hope and despair and everything in between--and there's no cure for being human.","['Spirituality', 'Self Help', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir', 'Religion', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Faith', 'Christian']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1627322749i/56552947.jpg,0593230779,9780593230770,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56552947-no-cure-for-being-human,224.0,4.13,2078.0,No Cure for Being Human: And Other Truths I Need to Hear,21498.0
David Sedaris,English,"Genius It is miraculous to read these pieces You must read The Best of Me. Andrew Sean Greer, New York Times Book ReviewANew York Times Book Review Editors ChoiceA CNN andChristian Science MonitorBest Book of the MonthFor more than twenty-five years, David Sedaris has been carving out a unique literary space, virtually creating his own genre. A Sedaris story may seem confessional, but is also highly attuned to the world outside. It opens our eyes to what is at absurd and moving about our daily existence. And it is almost impossible to read without laughing.Now, for the first time collected in one volume, the author brings us his funniest and most memorable work. In these stories, Sedaris shops for rare taxidermy, hitchhikes with a lady quadriplegic, and spits a lozenge into a fellow travelers lap. He drowns a mouse in a bucket, struggles to say give it to me in five languages, and hand-feeds a carnivorous bird.But if all you expect to find in Sedariss work is the deft and sharply observed comedy for which he became renowned, you may be surprised to discover that his words bring more warmth than mockery, more fellow-feeling than derision. Nowhere is this clearer than in his writing about his loved ones. In these pages, Sedaris explores falling in love and staying together, recognizing his own aging not in the mirror but in the faces of his siblings, losing one parent and coming to termsat long lastwith the other.Taken together, the stories in The Best of Me reveal the wonder and delight Sedaris takes in the surprises life brings him. No experience, he sees, is quite as he expectedits often harder, more fraught, and certainly weirderbut sometimes it is also much richer and more wonderful.Full of joy, generosity, and the incisive humor that has led David Sedaris to be called the funniest man alive (Time Out New York), The Best of Me spans a career spent watching and learning and laughingquite often at himselfand invites readers deep into the world of one of the most brilliant and original writers of our time.","['Comedy', 'Short Stories', 'Audiobook', 'Essays', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir', 'Humor', 'LGBT', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1598245328i/53487334.jpg,0316628247,9780316628242,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53487334-the-best-of-me,387.0,4.21,2194.0,The Best of Me,22921.0

But when a national nonprofit labels Big Burr ""the most homophobic town in the US"" and sends in a task force of queer volunteers as an experiment-they'll live and work in the community for two years in an attempt to broaden hearts and minds-no one is truly prepared for what will ensue. Furious at being uprooted from her life in Los Angeles and desperate to fit in at her new high school, Avery fears that it's only a matter of time before her ""gay crusader"" mom outs her. Still grieving the death of her son, Linda welcomes the arrivals, who know mercifully little about her past. And for Christine, the newcomers are not only a threat to the comforting rhythms of Big Burr life, but a call to action. As tensions roil the town, cratering relationships and forcing closely guarded secrets into the light, everyone must consider what it really means to belong. Told with warmth and wit, Under the Rainbow is a poignant, hopeful articulation of our complicated humanity that reminds us we are more alike than we'd like to admit.","['Novels', 'Audiobook', 'Queer', 'LGBT', 'Literary Fiction', 'Gay', 'Adult Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Fiction', 'Adult']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1564079712l/51846014.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51846014-under-the-rainbow,286.0,3.74,536.0,Under the Rainbow,3330.0

Melanie Benjamin,English,"From the New York Times bestselling author of The Aviator's Wife comes a story of courage on the prairie, inspired by the devastating storm that struck the Great Plains in 1888, threatening the lives of hundreds of immigrant homesteaders, especially schoolchildren.The morning of January 12, 1888, was unusually mild, following a punishing cold spell. It was warm enough for the homesteaders of the Dakota territory to venture out again, and for their children to return to school without their heavy coats--leaving them unprepared when disaster struck. At just the hour when most prairie schools were letting out for the day, a terrifying, fast-moving blizzard blew in without warning. Schoolteachers as young as sixteen were suddenly faced with life and death decisions: keep the children inside, to risk freezing to death when fuel ran out, or send them home, praying they wouldn't get lost in the storm?Based on actual oral histories of survivors, this gripping novel follows the stories of Raina and Gerda Olsen, two sisters, both schoolteachers--one who becomes a hero of the storm, and one who finds herself ostracized in the aftermath. It's also the story of Anette Pedersen, a servant girl whose miraculous survival serves as a turning point in her life and touches the heart of Gavin Woodson, a newspaperman seeking redemption. It was Woodson and others like him who wrote the embellished news stories that lured Northern European immigrants across the sea to settle a pitiless land. Boosters needed them to settle territories into states, and they didn't care what lies they told these families to get them there--or whose land it originally was.At its heart, this is a story of courage, of children forced to grow up too soon, tied to the land because of their parents' choices. It is a story of love taking root in the hard prairie ground, and of families being torn asunder by a ferocious storm that is little remembered today--because so many of its victims were immigrants to this country.","['Audiobook', 'Adventure', 'Survival', 'Family', 'Adult Fiction', 'American History', 'Historical', 'Fiction', 'Adult', 'Historical Fiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1593629147i/54353280.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54353280-the-children-s-blizzard,355.0,3.95,2841.0,The Children's Blizzard,20909.0

"Bill Gifford, Peter Attia",English,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER  A groundbreaking manifesto on living better and longer that challenges the conventional medical thinking on aging and reveals a new approach to preventing chronic disease and extending long-term health, from a visionary physician and leading longevity expert One of the most important books youll ever read.Steven D. Levitt, New York Times bestselling author of Freakonomics Wouldnt you like to live longer? And better? In this operating manual for longevity, Dr. Peter Attia draws on the latest science to deliver innovative nutritional interventions, techniques for optimizing exercise and sleep, and tools for addressing emotional and mental health. For all its successes, mainstream medicine has failed to make much progress against the diseases of aging that kill most people: heart disease, cancer, Alzheimers disease, and type 2 diabetes. Too often, it intervenes with treatments too late to help, prolonging lifespan at the expense of healthspan, or quality of life. Dr. Attia believes we must replace this outdated framework with a personalized, proactive strategy for longevity, one where we take action now, rather than waiting. This is not biohacking, its science: a well-founded strategic and tactical approach to extending lifespan while also improving our physical, cognitive, and emotional health. Dr. Attias aim is less to tell you what to do and more to help you learn how to think about long-term health, in order to create the best plan for you as an individual. In Outlive, readers will discover:  Why the cholesterol test at your annual physical doesnt tell you enough about your actual risk of dying from a heart attack. That you may already suffer from an extremely common yet underdiagnosed liver condition that could be a precursor to the chronic diseases of aging. Why exercise is the most potent pro-longevity drugand how to begin training for the Centenarian Decathlon. Why you should forget about diets, and focus instead on nutritional biochemistry, using technology and data to personalize your eating pattern. Why striving for physical health and longevity, but ignoring emotional health, could be the ultimate curse of all. Aging and longevity are far more malleable than we think; our fate is not set in stone. With the right roadmap, you can plot a different path for your life, one that lets you outlive your genes to make each decade better than the one before.","['Biology', 'Self Help', 'Audiobook', 'Medicine', 'Personal Development', 'Nutrition', 'Fitness', 'Health', 'Nonfiction', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1700067079i/61153739.jpg,0593236599,9780593236598,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61153739-outlive,496.0,4.39,4094.0,Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity,45279.0

Sir: If you occassionally buy this product, please kindly resend this letter to the World Human Right Organization.

David Grann,English,"From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Killers of the Flower Moon, a page-turning story of shipwreck, survival, and savagery, culminating in a court martial that reveals a shocking truth. The powerful narrative reveals the deeper meaning of the events on the Wager, showing that it was not only the captain and crew who ended up on trial, but the very idea of empire.On January 28, 1742, a ramshackle vessel of patched-together wood and cloth washed up on the coast of Brazil. Inside were thirty emaciated men, barely alive, and they had an extraordinary tale to tell. They were survivors of His Majesty's Ship the Wager, a British vessel that had left England in 1740 on a secret mission during an imperial war with Spain. While the Wager had been chasing a Spanish treasure-filled galleon known as ""the prize of all the oceans,"" it had wrecked on a desolate island off the coast of Patagonia. The men, after being marooned for months and facing starvation, built the flimsy craft and sailed for more than a hundred days, traversing nearly 3,000 miles of storm-wracked seas. They were greeted as heroes.But then . . . six months later, another, even more decrepit craft landed on the coast of Chile. This boat contained just three castaways, and they told a very different story. The thirty sailors who landed in Brazil were not heroes - they were mutineers. The first group responded with countercharges of their own, of a tyrannical and murderous senior officer and his henchmen. It became clear that while stranded on the island the crew had fallen into anarchy, with warring factions fighting for dominion over the barren wilderness. As accusations of treachery and murder flew, the Admiralty convened a court martial to determine who was telling the truth. The stakes were life-and-death--for whomever the court found guilty could hang.The Wager is a grand tale of human behavior at the extremes told by one of our greatest nonfiction writers. Grann's recreation of the hidden world on a British warship rivals the work of Patrick O'Brian, his portrayal of the castaways' desperate straits stands up to the classics of survival writing such as The Endurance, and his account of the court martial has the savvy of a Scott Turow thriller. As always with Grann's work, the incredible twists of the narrative hold the reader spellbound.","['Crime', 'History', 'Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Survival', 'Mystery', 'True Crime', 'Nonfiction', 'Historical', 'Adventure']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1659407155i/61714633.jpg,0385534264,9780385534260,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61714633-the-wager,354.0,4.21,10452.0,"The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder",98791.0
Gabrielle Stanley Blair,English,"In Ejaculate Responsibly, Gabrielle Blairoffers a provocative reframing of the abortion issue in post-Roe America. In a series of 28brief arguments, she deftly makes the case for moving the abortion debate away fromcontrolling and legislating womens bodies and instead directs the focus on mens lack of accountability in preventing unwanted pregnancies.Highly readable, accessible, funny, and unflinching, Blair builds her argument by walking readers through the basics of fertility (men are 50 times more fertile than woman), the unfair burden placed on women when it comes to preventing pregnancy (90% of the birth control market is for women), the wrongheaded stigmas around birth control for men (condoms make sex less pleasurable, vasectomies are scary and emasculating), and the counterintuitive reality that men, who are fertile 100% of the time, take little to no responsibility for preventing pregnancy. The result is a compelling and convincing case for placing the responsibilityand burdenofpreventing unwanted pregnancies away from women andonto men.","['Womens', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Social Justice', 'Essays', 'Sociology', 'Feminism', 'Health', 'Nonfiction', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1658246301i/61278539.jpg,1523523182,9781523523184,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61278539-ejaculate-responsibly,137.0,4.52,1758.0,Ejaculate Responsibly: A Whole New Way to Think About Abortion,7259.0

  A grand tour through the hidden realms of animal senses that will transform the way you perceive the world
  --from the Pulitzer Prize-winning, New York Times bestselling author of I Contain Multitudes.
The Earth teems with sights and textures, sounds and vibrations, smells and tastes, electric and magnetic fields. But every animal is enclosed within its own unique sensory bubble, perceiving but a tiny sliver of an immense world. This book welcomes us into a previously unfathomable dimension--the world as it is truly perceived by other animals.We encounter beetles that are drawn to fires, turtles that can track the Earth's magnetic fields, fish that fill rivers with electrical messages, and humans that wield sonar like bats. We discover that a crocodile's scaly face is as sensitive as a lover's fingertips, that the eyes of a giant squid evolved to see sparkling whales, that plants thrum with the inaudible songs of courting bugs, and that even simple scallops have complex vision. We learn what bees see in flowers, what songbirds hear in their tunes, and what dogs smell on the street. We listen to stories of pivotal discoveries in the field, while looking ahead at the many mysteries which lie unsolved.In An Immense World, author and acclaimed science journalist Ed Yong coaxes us beyond the confines of our own senses, allowing us to perceive the skeins of scent, waves of electromagnetism, and pulses of pressure that surround us. Because in order to understand our world we don't need to travel to other places; we need to see through other eyes.","['Biology', 'Science Nature', 'Animals', 'Audiobook', 'Psychology', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Environment', 'Nonfiction', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1652105350i/59575939.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59575939-an-immense-world,464.0,4.47,3524.0,An Immense World: How Animal Senses Reveal the Hidden Realms Around Us,22525.0

Standing up in front of the profession for whom he is a mentally ill person suffering from gender dysphoria, Preciado draws inspiration in his lecture from Kafkas Report to an Academy, in which a monkey tells an assembly of scientists that human subjectivity is a cage comparable to one made of metal bars.Speaking from his own mutant cage, Preciado does not so much criticize the homophobia and transphobia of the founding fathers of psychoanalysis as demonstrate the disciplines complicity with the ideology of sexual differencedating back to the colonial era, an ideology which is today rendered obsolete by technological advances allowing us to alter our bodies and procreate differently. Further, Preciado calls for a radical transformation of psychological andpsychoanalytic discourse and practices, arguing for a new epistemology capable of allowing for a multiplicity of living bodies without reducing the body to its sole heterosexual reproductive capability, and without legitimizing heteropatriarchal and colonial violence.Causing a veritable outcry among the assembly, Preciado was heckled and booed and unable to finish.

Tom Felton,English,"From the magical moments on set as Draco Malfoy to the challenges of growing up in the spotlight, get a backstage pass into Tom Feltons life on and off the big screen in this #1 New York Times bestseller. Tom Feltons adolescence was anything but ordinary. His early rise to fame in beloved films like 
  The Borrowers 
catapulted him into the limelight, but nothing could prepare him for what was to come after he landed the iconic role of the Draco Malfoy, the bleached blonde villain of the 
  Harry Potter
 movies. For the next ten years, he was at the center of a huge pop culture phenomenon and yet, in between filming, he would go back to being a normal teenager trying to fit into a normal school.  Speaking with great candor and his signature humor, Tom shares his experience growing up as part of the wizarding world while also trying to navigate the muggle world. He tells stories from his early days in the business like his first acting gig where he was mistaken for fellow blonde child actor Macaulay Culkin and his 
  Harry Potter
 audition where, in a very Draco-like move, he fudged how well he knew the books the series was based on (not at all). He reflects on his experiences working with cinematic greats such as Alan Rickman, Sir Michael Gambon, Dame Maggie Smith, and Ralph Fiennes (including that awkward Voldemort hug). And, perhaps most poignantly, he discusses the lasting relationships he made over that decade of filming, including with Emma Watson, who started out as a pesky nine-year-old whom he mocked for not knowing what a boom mic was but who soon grew into one of his dearest friends. Then, of course, there are the highs and lows of fame and navigating life after such a momentous and life-changing experience. Tom Feltons 
  Beyond the Wand
 is an entertaining, funny, and poignant must-read for any

 fan.

Enchanted by the undersea world of her childhood, she excels in marine biology, travelling the globe to study ancient organisms. When a trench is discovered in the Atlantic ocean, Leigh joins the exploration team, hoping to find evidence of the earth's first life forms - what she instead finds calls into question everything we know about our own beginnings.Her discovery leads Leigh to the Mojave desert and an ambitious new space agency. Drawn deeper into the agency's work, she learns that the Atlantic trench is only one of several related phenomena from across the world, each piece linking up to suggest a pattern beyond human understanding.

Susan Cain,English,"In her new masterpiece, the author of the bestselling phenomenon Quiet reveals the power of a bittersweet outlook on life, and why weve been so blind to its value.With Quiet, Susan Cain urged our society to cultivate space for the undervalued, indispensable introverts among us, thereby revealing an untapped power hidden in plain sight. Now she employs the same mix of research, storytelling, and memoir to explore why we experience sorrow and longing, and the surprising lessons these states of mind teach us about creativity, compassion, leadership, spirituality, mortality, and love. Bittersweetness is a tendency to states of longing, poignancy, and sorrow; an acute awareness of passing time; and a curiously piercing joy when beholding beauty. It recognizes that light and dark, birth and deathbitter and sweetare forever paired. A song in a minor key, an elegiac poem, or even a touching television commercial all can bring us to this sublime, even holy, state of mindand, ultimately, to greater kinship with our fellow humans. But bittersweetness is not, as we tend to think, just a momentary feeling or event. Its also a way of being, a storied heritage. Our artistic and spiritual traditionsamplified by recent scientific and management researchteach us its power. Cain shows how a bittersweet state of mind is the quiet force that helps us transcend our personal and collective pain. If we dont acknowledge our own sorrows and longings, she says, we can end up inflicting them on others via abuse, domination, or neglect. But if we realize that all humans knowor will knowloss and suffering, we can turn toward each other. And we can learn to transform our own pain into creativity, transcendence, and connection. At a time of profound discord and personal anxiety, Bittersweet brings us together in deep and unexpected ways.","['Spirituality', 'Self Help', 'Audiobook', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Philosophy', 'Health', 'Nonfiction', 'Mental Health', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1637095772i/58734811.jpg,0451499786,9780451499783,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58734811-bittersweet,310.0,3.98,2595.0,Bittersweet: How Sorrow and Longing Make Us Whole,20946.0

As punishment for a past rebellion, nine Greek gods are forced to walk the earth as mortals, hunted by the descendants of ancient bloodlines, all eager to kill a god and seize their divine power and immortality.Long ago, Lore Perseous fled that brutal world in the wake of her family's sadistic murder by a rival line, turning her back on the hunt's promises of eternal glory. For years she's pushed away any thought of revenge against the man--now a god--responsible for their deaths.Yet as the next hunt dawns over New York City, two participants seek out her help: Castor, a childhood friend of Lore believed long dead, and a gravely wounded Athena, among the last of the original gods.The goddess offers an alliance against their mutual enemy and, at last, a way for Lore to leave the Agon behind forever. But Lore's decision to bind her fate to Athena's and rejoin the hunt will come at a deadly cost--and still may not be enough to stop the rise of a new god with the power to bring humanity to its knees.","['Young Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Retellings', 'Romance', 'Mythology', 'Young Adult Fantasy', 'Greek Mythology', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Urban Fantasy']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1594222283i/53375824.jpg,1484778200,9781484778203,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53375824-lore,480.0,3.76,14162.0,Lore,91703.0

Together, Harriet and Annis must resist her stepmother's agenda, lest she -- and the dashing young lord she suspects she could come to love -- lose their freedom, and possibly their lives.","['Adult', 'Paranormal', 'Magic', 'Romance', 'Historical Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Witches', 'Historical Fiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1572032193i/48578861.jpg,0356512584,9780356512587,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48578861-the-age-of-witches,528.0,3.92,764.0,The Age of Witches,7454.0

Kate Manne,English,"An urgent exploration of mens entitlement and how it serves to police and punish women, from the acclaimed author of Down Girl.In this bold and stylish critique, Cornell philosopher Kate Manne offers a radical new framework for understanding misogyny. Ranging widely across the culture, from Harvey Weinstein and the Brett Kavanaugh hearings to Cat Person and the political misfortunes of Elizabeth Warren, Mannes book shows how privileged mens sense of entitlementto sex, yes, but more insidiously to admiration, care, bodily autonomy, knowledge, and poweris a pervasive social problem with often devastating consequences.In clear, lucid prose, Manne argues that male entitlement can explain a wide array of phenomena, from mansplaining and the undertreatment of womens pain to mass shootings by incels and the seemingly intractable notion that women are unelectable. Moreover, Manne implicates each of us in toxic masculinity: Its not just a product of a few bad actors; its something we all perpetuate, conditioned as we are by the social and cultural mores of our time. The only way to combat it, she says, is to expose the flaws in our default modes of thought while enabling women to take up space, say their piece, and muster resistance to the entitled attitudes of the men around them.With wit and intellectual fierceness, Manne sheds new light on gender and power and offers a vision of a world in which women are just as entitled as men to our collective care and concern.","['Gender', 'Womens', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Social Justice', 'Essays', 'Sociology', 'Feminism', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1594850499i/50726976.jpg,1984826565,9781984826565,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50726976-entitled,269.0,4.21,603.0,Entitled: How Male Privilege Hurts Women,4698.0

Andy Borowitz,English,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER * WALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLER *WASHINGTON POST BESTSELLER * Andy Borowitz, one of the funniest people in America (CBS Sunday Morning), brilliantly chronicles our embrace of anti-intellectualism (Walter Isaacson) in American politics, from Ronald Reagan to Dan Quayle, from George W. Bush to Sarah Palin, to its apotheosis in Donald J. Trump.Andy Borowitz has been called a Swiftian satirist (The Wall Street Journal) and one of the countrys finest satirists (The New York Times). Millions of fans and New Yorker readers enjoy his satirical news column The Borowitz Report. Now, in Profiles in Ignorance, he delivers a wittily alarming polemic that tracks the evolution of American politics from grounds for gravitas to festival of idiocy (The New York Times). Borowitz argues that over the past fifty years, American politicians have grown increasingly allergic to knowledge, and mass media have encouraged the election of ignoramuses by elevating candidates who are better at performing than thinking. Starting with Ronald Reagans first campaign for governor of California in 1966 and culminating with the election of Donald J. Trump to the White House, Borowitz shows how, during the age of twenty-four-hour news and social media, the US has elected politicians to positions of great power whose lack of the most basic information is terrifying. In addition to Reagan, Quayle, Bush, Palin, and Trump, Borowitz covers a host of congresspersons, senators, and governors who have helped lower the bar over the past five decades. Profiles in Ignorance aims to make us both laugh and laugh at the idiotic antics of these public figures, and cry at the cataclysms these icons of ignorance have caused. But most importantly, the book delivers a call to action and a cause for History doesnt move in a straight line, and we can change course if we act now.","['History', 'Comedy', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Unfinished', 'Humor', 'American History', 'Nonfiction', 'Historical', 'Political Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1644431712i/60380355.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60380355-profiles-in-ignorance,313.0,4.35,614.0,Profiles in Ignorance: How America's Politicians Got Dumb and Dumber,3878.0

Tola Rotimi Abraham,English,"Simultaneously unique and universal (NPR), this fiercely original debut novel follows the fate of four siblings over the course of two decades in Nigeria as they search for agency, love, and meaning in a society rife with hypocrisy.""I like the idea of a god who knows what it's like to be a twin. To have no memory of ever being alone.""Twin sisters Bibike and Ariyike are enjoying a relatively comfortable life in Lagos in 1996. Then their mother loses her job due to political strife, and the family, facing poverty, becomes drawn into the New Church, an institution led by a charismatic pastor who is not shy about worshipping earthly wealth.Soon Bibike and Ariyike's father wagers the family home on a ""sure bet"" that evaporates like smoke. As their parents' marriage collapses in the aftermath of this gamble, the twin sisters and their two younger siblings, Andrew and Peter, are thrust into the reluctant care of their traditional Yoruba grandmother. Inseparable while they had their parents to care for them, the twins' paths diverge once the household shatters. Each girl is left to locate, guard, and hone her own fragile source of power.Written with astonishing intimacy and wry attention to the fickleness of fate, Tola Rotimi Abraham's Black Sunday takes us into the chaotic heart of family life, tracing a line from the euphoria of kinship to the devastation of estrangement. In the process, it joyfully tells a tale of grace and connection in the midst of daily oppression and the constant incursions of an unremitting patriarchy. This is a novel about two young women slowly finding, over twenty years, in a place rife with hypocrisy but also endless life and love, their own distinct methods of resistance and paths to independence.","['Audiobook', 'African Literature', 'Nigeria', 'Literary Fiction', 'Family', 'Contemporary', 'Historical', 'Fiction', 'Africa', 'Historical Fiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1563558236i/42515198.jpg,1948226561,9781948226561,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42515198-black-sunday,277.0,3.65,342.0,Black Sunday,2754.0

Only moments earlier she had been fending off masses of birds in a snow-covered forest. In bed, when she blinks, the head disappears.Night after night, Mackenzie's dreams return her to a memory from before her sister Sabrina's untimely death: a weekend at the family's lakefront campsite, long obscured by a fog of guilt.

"Charles Person, Richard Rooker",English,"A firsthand exploration of the cost of boarding the bus of change to move America forward--written by one of the Civil Rights Movement's pioneers.At 18, Charles Person was the youngest of the original Freedom Riders, key figures in the U.S. Civil Rights Movement who left Washington, D.C. by bus in 1961, headed for New Orleans. This purposeful mix of black and white, male and female activists--including future Congressman John Lewis, Congress of Racial Equality Director James Farmer, Reverend Benjamin Elton Cox, journalist and pacifist James Peck, and CORE field secretary Genevieve Hughes--set out to discover whether America would abide by a Supreme Court decision that ruled segregation unconstitutional in bus depots, waiting areas, restaurants, and restrooms nationwide.The Freedom Riders found their answer. No. Southern states would continue to disregard federal law and use violence to enforce racial segregation. One bus was burned to a shell; the second, which Charles rode, was set upon by a mob that beat the Riders nearly to death.Buses Are a Comin' provides a front-row view of the struggle to belong in America, as Charles leads his colleagues off the bus, into the station, into the mob, and into history to help defeat segregation's violent grip on African American lives. It is also a challenge from a teenager of a previous era to the young people of today: become agents of transformation. Stand firm. Create a more just and moral country where students have a voice, youth can make a difference, and everyone belongs.","['History', 'Social Justice', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir', 'Race', 'Biography', 'American History', 'Nonfiction', 'Historical', 'Adult']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1613417823i/53137965.jpg,1250274192,9781250274199,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53137965-buses-are-a-comin,304.0,4.49,214.0,Buses Are a Comin': Memoir of a Freedom Rider,819.0
Joanne Limburg,English,"It seemed to me that many of the moments when my autism had caused problems, or at least marked me out as different, were those moments when I had come up against some unspoken law about how a girl or a woman should be, and failed to meet it.An autism diagnosis in midlife enabled Joanne Limburg to finally make sense of why her emotional expression, social discomfort and presentation had always marked her as an outsider. Eager to discover other women who had been misunderstood in their time, she writes a series of wide-ranging letters to four 'weird sisters' from history, addressing topics including autistic parenting, social isolation, feminism, the movement for disability rights and the appalling punishments that have been meted out over centuries to those deemed to fall short of the norm. This heartfelt, deeply compassionate and wholly original work humanises women who have so often been dismissed for their differences, and will be celebrated by 'weird sisters' everywhere.","['History', 'Psychology', 'Essays', 'Memoir', 'Feminism', 'Biography', 'Autistic Spectrum Disorder', 'Disability', 'Nonfiction', 'Mental Health']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1617980428i/57676683.jpg,1838950052,9781838950057,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57676683-letters-to-my-weird-sisters,272.0,4.16,78.0,Letters to My Weird Sisters: On Autism and Feminism,526.0

The area of the Central Valley where fourteen-year-old Lacey May and her alcoholic mother live was once an agricultural paradise. Now its an environmental disaster, a place of cracked earth and barren raisin farms. In their desperation, residents have turned to a cult leader named Pastor Vern for guidance. He promises, through secret assignments, to bring the rain everybody is praying for. Lacey has no reason to doubt the pastor. But then her life explodes in a single unimaginable act of abandonment: her mother, exiled from the community for her sins, leaves Lacey and runs off with a man she barely knows. Abandoned and distraught, Lacey May moves in with her widowed grandma, Cherry, who is more concerned with her taxidermy mice collection than her own granddaughter.

Max Fisher,English,"From a New York Times investigative reporter and Pulitzer Prize finalist, an essential book for our times (Ezra Klein), tracking the high-stakes inside story of how Big Techs breakneck race to drive engagementand profitsat all costs fractured the worldWe all have a vague sense that social media is bad for our minds, for our children, and for our democracies. But the truth is that its reach and impact run far deeper than we have understood. Building on years of international reporting, Max Fisher tells the gripping and galling inside story of how Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other social networks, in their pursuit of unfettered profits, preyed on psychological frailties to create the algorithms that drive everyday users to extreme opinions and, increasingly, extreme actions. As Fisher demonstrates, the companies founding tenets, combined with a blinkered focus maximizing engagement, have led to a destabilized world for everyone. Traversing the planet, Fisher tracks the ubiquity of hate speech and its spillover into violence, ills that first festered in far-off locales to their dark culmination in America during the pandemic, the 2020 election, and the Capitol Insurrection. Through it all, the social-media giants refused to intervene in any meaningful way, claiming to champion free speech when in fact what they most prized were limitless profits. The result, as Fisher shows, is a cultural shift toward a world in which people are polarized not by beliefs based on facts, but by misinformation, outrage, and fear. His narrative is about more than the villains, however. Fisher also weaves together the stories of the heroic outsiders and Silicon Valley defectors who raised the alarm and revealed what was happening behind the closed doors of Big Tech. Both panoramic and intimate, The Chaos Machine is the definitive account of the meteoric rise and troubled legacy of the tech titans, as well as a rousing and hopeful call to arrest the havoc wreaked on our minds and our world before its too late.","['History', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Psychology', 'Technology', 'Sociology', 'Business', 'Social Media', 'Nonfiction', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1632076475i/58950736.jpg,031670332X,9780316703321,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58950736-the-chaos-machine,400.0,4.3,897.0,The Chaos Machine: The Inside Story of How Social Media Rewired Our Minds and Our World,5277.0
NoViolet Bulawayo,English,"From the award-winning author of the Booker Prize finalist We Need New Names, an exhilarating novel about the fall of an oppressive regime, and the chaos and opportunity that rise in its wake.NoViolet Bulawayos bold new novel follows the fall of the Old Horse, the long-serving leader of a fictional country, and the drama that follows for a rumbustious nation of animals on the path to true liberation. Inspired by the unexpected fall by coup in November 2017 of Robert G. Mugabe, Zimbabwes president of nearly four decades, Glory shows a country's imploding, narrated by a chorus of animal voices that unveil the ruthlessness required to uphold the illusion of absolute power and the imagination and bulletproof optimism to overthrow it completely. By immersing listeners in the daily lives of a population in upheaval, Bulawayo reveals the dazzling life force and irresistible wit that lie barely concealed beneath the surface of seemingly bleak circumstances.And at the center of this tumult is Destiny, a young goat who returns to Jidada to bear witness to revolution - and to recount the unofficial history and the potential legacy of the females who have quietly pulled the strings here. The animal kingdom - its connection to our primal responses and its resonance in the mythology, folktales, and fairy tales that define cultures the world over - unmasks the surreality of contemporary global politics to help us understand our world more clearly, even as Bulawayo plucks us right out of it.Although Zimbabwe is the immediate inspiration for this thrilling story, Glory was written in a time of global clamor, with resistance movements across the world challenging different forms of oppression. Thus it often feels like Bulawayo captures several places in one blockbuster allegory, crystallizing a turning point in history with the texture and nuance that only the greatest fiction can.","['Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Zimbabwe', 'Literary Fiction', 'Historical', 'Contemporary', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Africa', 'Historical Fiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1651658106i/61030787.jpg,0593492498,9780593492499,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61030787-glory,416.0,3.71,895.0,Glory,4807.0

Safia Elhillo,English,"Intimate poems that explore feminine shame and violence and imagine what liberation from these threats might look like, from the award-winning author of The January ChildrenIn Girls That Never Die, award-winning poet Safia Elhillo reinvents the epic to explore Muslim girlhood and shame, the dangers of being a woman, and the myriad violences enacted and imagined against womens bodies. Drawing from her own life and family histories, as well as cultural myths and news stories about honor killings and genital mutilation, she interlaces the everyday traumas of growing up a girl under patriarchy with magical realist imaginings of rebellion, autonomy, and power.  Elhillo writes a new world: women escape their stonings by birds that carry the rocks away; slain girls grow into two, like the hydra of lore, sprouting too numerous to ever be eradicated; circles of women are deemed holy, protected. Ultimately, Girls That Never Die is about wrestling ourselves from the threats of violence that constrain our lives, and instead looking to freedom and questioning: [what if i will not die] [what will govern me then]","['Audiobook', 'African Literature', 'Sudan', 'Feminism', 'Religion', 'The United States Of America', 'Contemporary', 'Poetry', 'Nonfiction', 'Africa']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1642872394i/59788399.jpg,,9780593229484,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59788399-girls-that-never-die,144.0,4.3,189.0,Girls That Never Die: Poems,1123.0

What they saw introduced a radical concept that swept through biology and medicine, touching virtually every aspect of the two sciences, and altering both forever. It was the fact that complex living organisms are assemblages of tiny, self-contained, self-regulating units. Our organs, our physiology, our selveshearts, blood, brainsare built from these compartments. Hooke christened them  cells. The discovery of cellsand the reframing of the human body as a cellular ecosystemannounced the birth of a new kind of medicine based on the therapeutic manipulations of cells. A hip fracture, a cardiac arrest, Alzheimers dementia, AIDS, pneumonia, lung cancer, kidney failure, arthritis, COVID pneumoniaall could be reconceived as the results of cells, or systems of cells, functioning abnormally. And all could be perceived as loci of cellular therapies.Filled with writing so vivid, lucid, and suspenseful that complex science becomes thrilling, The Song of the Cell tells the story of how scientists discovered cells, began to understand them, and are now using that knowledge to create new humans. Told in six parts, and laced with Mukherjees own experience as a researcher, a doctor, and a prolific reader, The Song of the Cell is both panoramic and intimatea masterpiece on what it means to be human.In an account both lyrical and capacious, Mukherjee takes us through an evolution of human from the seventeenth-century discovery that humans are made up of cells to our cutting-edge technologies for manipulating and deploying cells for therapeutic purposes ( The New Yorker).","['History', 'Biology', 'Audiobook', 'Medicine', 'Popular Science', 'Nature', 'Health', 'Nonfiction', 'Medical', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1666198162i/60321392.jpg,1982117354,9781982117351,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60321392-the-song-of-the-cell,473.0,4.29,1316.0,The Song of the Cell: An Exploration of Medicine and the New Human,10241.0

"Penny Wilson, Greg King",English,"In the tradition of Erik Larson's Dead Wake comes The Last Voyage of the Andrea Doria , about the sinking of the glamorous Italian ocean liner, including never-before-seen photos of the wreck today.In 1956, a stunned world watched as the famous Italian ocean liner Andrea Doria sank after being struck by a Swedish vessel off the coast of Nantucket. Unlike the tragedy of the Titanic , this sinking played out in real time across radios and televisions, the first disaster of the modern age. Audiences witnessed everything that ensued after the unthinkable collision of two modern vessels equipped with radar: perilous hours of uncertainty; the heroic rescue of passengers; and the final gasp as the pride of the Italian fleet slipped beneath the Atlantic, taking some fifty lives with her. Her loss signaled the end of the golden age of ocean liner travel.Now, Greg King and Penny Wilson offer a fresh look at this legendary liner and her tragic fate. Andrea Doria represented the romance of travel, the possibility of new lives in the new world, and the glamour of 1950s art, culture, and life. Set against a glorious backdrop of celebrity and La Dolce Vita, Andrea Doria 's last voyage comes vividly to life in a narrative tightly focused on her passengers  Cary Grant's wife; Philadelphia's flamboyant mayor; the heiress to the Marshall Field fortune; and many brave Italian emigrants  who found themselves plunged into a desperate struggle to survive. The Last Voyage of the Andrea Doria follows the effect this trauma had on their lives, and brings the story up-to-date with the latest expeditions to the wreck.Drawing on in-depth research, interviews with survivors, and never-before-seen photos of the wreck as it is today, The Last Voyage of the Andrea Doria is a vibrant story of fatal errors, shattered lives, and the triumph of the human spirit.","['Maritime', 'History', 'Audiobook', 'World History', 'Memoir', 'Research', 'Nonfiction', 'Historical', 'Italy', 'Adventure']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1579070686i/45046696.jpg,1250194539,9781250194534,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45046696-the-last-voyage-of-the-andrea-doria,352.0,3.93,112.0,The Last Voyage of the Andrea Doria: The Sinking of the World's Most Glamorous Ship,461.0
Colin Jost,English,"If theres one trait that makes someone well suited to comedy, its being able to take a punchmetaphorically and, occasionally, physically. From growing up in a family of firefighters on Staten Island to commuting three hours a day to high school and seeing the sights (like watching a Russian woman throw a stroller off the back of a ferry), to attending Harvard while Facebook was created, Jost shares how he has navigated the world like a slightly smarter Forrest Gump.Youll also discover things about Jost that will surprise and confuse you, like how Jimmy Buffett saved his life, how Czech teenagers attacked him with potato salad, how an insect laid eggs inside his legs, and how he competed in a twenty-five-man match at WrestleMania (and almost won). Youll go behind the scenes at SNL and Weekend Update (where hes written some of the most memorable sketches and jokes of the past fifteen years). And youll experience the life of a touring stand-up comedianfrom performing in rural college cafeterias at noon to opening for Dave Chappelle at Radio City Music Hall.For every accomplishment (hosting the Emmys), there is a setback (hosting the Emmys).

Steven E. Koonin,English,"Surging sea levels are inundating the coasts.Hurricanes and tornadoes are becoming fiercer and more frequent.Climate change will be an economic disaster.Youve heard all this presented as fact. But according to science, all of these statements are profoundly misleading.When it comes to climate change, the media, politicians, and other prominent voices have declared that the science is settled. In reality, the long game of telephone from research to reports to the popular media is corrupted by misunderstanding and misinformation. Core questionsabout the way the climate is responding to our influence, and what the impacts will beremain largely unanswered. The climate is changing, but the why and how arent as clear as youve probably been led to believe. Now, one of Americas most distinguished scientists is clearing away the fog to explain what science really says (and doesnt say) about our changing climate. In Unsettled: What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn't, and Why It Matters, Steven Koonin draws upon his decades of experienceincluding as a top science advisor to the Obama administrationto provide up-to-date insights and expert perspective free from political agendas. Fascinating, clear-headed, and full of surprises, this book gives readers the tools to both understand the climate issue and be savvier consumers of science media in general. Koonin takes readers behind the headlines to the more nuanced science itself, showing us where it comes from and guiding us through the implications of the evidence. He dispels popular myths and unveils little-known truths: despite a dramatic rise in greenhouse gas emissions, global temperatures actually decreased from 1940 to 1970. Whats more, the models we use to predict the future arent able to accurately describe the climate of the past, suggesting they are deeply flawed. Koonin also tackles societys response to a changing climate, using data-driven analysis to explain why many proposed solutions would be ineffective, and discussing how alternatives like adaptation and, if necessary, geoengineering will ensure humanity continues to prosper. Unsettled is a reality check buoyed by hope, offering the truth about climate science that you arent getting elsewherewhat we know, what we dont, and what it all means for our future.","['History', 'Politics', 'Popular Science', 'Climate Change', 'Education', 'Economics', 'Nature', 'Environment', 'Nonfiction', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1615913131i/57433539.jpg,195329524X,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57433539-unsettled,320.0,4.27,464.0,"Unsettled: What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn’t, and Why It Matters",3203.0

Kelly Williams Brown,English,"From the New York Times bestselling author of Adulting comes a story about how to make something when you're capable of nothing. Kelly Williams Brown had 700 Bad Days. Her marriage collapsed, she broke three limbs in separate and unrelated incidents, her father was diagnosed with cancer, and she fell into a deep depression that ended in what could delicately be referred to as a ""rest cure"" at an inpatient facility. Before that, she had several very good years: she wrote a bestselling book, spoke at NASA, had a beautiful wedding, and inspired hundreds of thousands of readers to live as grown-ups in an often-screwed-up world, though these accomplishments mostly just made her feel fraudulent.One of the few things that kept her moving forward was, improbably, crafting. Not Martha Stewart-perfect crafting, either--what could be called ""simple,"" ""accessible"" or, perhaps, ""rustic"" creations were the joy and accomplishments she found in her worst days. To craft is to set things right in the littlest of ways; no matter how disconnected you feel, you can still fold a tiny paper star, and that's not nothing.In Easy Crafts for the Insane, crafting tutorials serve as the backdrop of a life dissolved, then glued back together. Surprising, humane, and utterly unforgettable, this is a poignant and hysterical look at the unexpected, messy coping mechanisms we use to find ourselves again.","['Self Help', 'Audiobook', 'Psychology', 'Memoir', 'Humor', 'Mental Illness', 'Crafts', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Mental Health']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1605571051i/55725739.jpg,0593187784,9780593187784,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55725739-easy-crafts-for-the-insane,288.0,3.81,232.0,Easy Crafts for the Insane: A Mostly Funny Memoir of Mental Illness and Making Things,1339.0

"Riz Ahmed, James McAvoy, Andy Serkis, Bebe Neuwirth, Kat Dennings, Taron Egerton, Michael Sheen, Arthur Darvill, Dirk Maggs, Miriam Margolyes, Samantha Morton, Neil Gaiman",English,"Hailed by the Los Angeles Times Magazine as the greatest epic in the history of comic books, The Sandman changed the game with its dark, literary world of fantasy and horror - creating a global, cultural phenomenon in the process. At long last, Audible and DC present the first-ever audio production of the New York Times best-selling series written by acclaimed storyteller Neil Gaiman (who also serves as co-executive producer). Adapted and directed by multi-award-winner (and frequent Gaiman collaborator) Dirk Maggs, and performed by an ensemble cast with James McAvoy (It, Parts One and Two, X-Men: First Class, Split) in the title role, this first installment of a multi-part original audio series will transport you to a world that re-writes the rules of audio entertainment the way that The Sandman originally re-defined the graphic novel.When The Sandman, also known as Lord Morpheus - the immortal king of dreams, stories and the imagination - is pulled from his realm and imprisoned on Earth by a nefarious cult, he languishes for decades before finally escaping. Once free, he must retrieve the three tools that will restore his power and help him to rebuild his dominion, which has deteriorated in his absence. As the multi-threaded story unspools, The Sandman descends into Hell to confront Lucifer (Michael Sheen), chases rogue nightmares who have escaped his realm, and crosses paths with an array of characters from DC comic books, ancient myths, and real-world history, including: Inmates of Gotham City's Arkham Asylum, Doctor Destiny, the muse Calliope, the three Fates, William Shakespeare (Arthur Darvill), and many more.A powerhouse supporting cast helps translate this masterwork into a sonic experience worthy of its legacy, including Riz Ahmed, Kat Dennings, Taron Egerton, Samantha Morton, Bebe Neuwirth, Andy Serkis, and more. Setting the stage for their performance is an unprecedented cinematic soundscape featuring an original musical score by British Academy Award winner James Hannigan. Fans will especially revel in a new twist for the audio adaptation: Neil Gaiman himself serves as the narrator. Follow him as he leads listeners along a winding path of myths, imagination and, often, terror.

WINNER OF THE PORCHLIGHT BUSINESS BOOK AWARD  ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE Time, The Washington Post, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Ms. magazine, BookRiot, Library Journal This is the book Ive been waiting for.Ibram X. Kendi, #1 New York Times bestselling author of How to Be an Antiracist Look for the authors podcast, The Sum of Us, based on this book!Heather McGhees specialty is the American economyand the mystery of why it so often fails the American public. From the financial crisis of 2008 to rising student debt to collapsing public infrastructure, she found a root racism in our politics and policymaking. But not just in the most obvious indignities for people of color. Racism has costs for white people, too. It is the common denominator of our most vexing public problems, the core dysfunction of our democracy and constitutive of the spiritual and moral crises that grip us all. But how did this happen? And is there a way out?McGhee embarks on a deeply personal journey across the country from Maine to Mississippi to California, tallying what we lose when we buy into the zero-sum paradigmthe idea that progress for some of us must come at the expense of others. Along the way, she meets white people who confide in her about losing their homes, their dreams, and their shot at better jobs to the toxic mix of American racism and greed. This is the story of how public goods in this countryfrom parks and pools to functioning schoolshave become private luxuries; of how unions collapsed, wages stagnated, and inequality increased; and of how this country, unique among the worlds advanced economies, has thwarted universal healthcare.But in unlikely places of worship and work, McGhee finds proof of what she calls the Solidarity the benefits we gain when people come together across race to accomplish what we simply cant do on our own. The Sum of Us is not only a brilliant analysis of how we arrived here but also a heartfelt message, delivered with startling empathy, from a black woman to a multiracial America. It leaves us with a new vision for a future in which we finally realize that life can be more than a zero-sum game.LONGLISTED FOR THE ANDREW CARNEGIE MEDAL","['History', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Social Justice', 'Economics', 'Race', 'Sociology', 'African American', 'Nonfiction', 'Anti Racist']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1613746068i/53928578.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53928578-the-sum-of-us,394.0,4.64,2639.0,The Sum of Us: What Racism Costs Everyone and How We Can Prosper Together,18027.0

Robert Jones Jr.,English,"Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780593085684A novel about the forbidden union between two enslaved young men on a Deep South plantation, the refuge they find in each other, and a betrayal that threatens their existence.Isaiah was Samuels and Samuel was Isaiahs. That was the way it was since the beginning, and the way it was to be until the end. In the barn they tended to the animals, but also to each other, transforming the hollowed-out shed into a place of human refuge, a source of intimacy and hope in a world ruled by vicious masters. But when an older mana fellow slaveseeks to gain favor by preaching the masters gospel on the plantation, the enslaved begin to turn on their own. Isaiah and Samuels love, which was once so simple, is seen as sinful and a clear danger to the plantations harmony.With a lyricism reminiscent of Toni Morrison, Robert Jones, Jr. fiercely summons the voices of slaver and the enslaved alike to tell the story of these two men; from Amos the preacher to the calculating slave-master himself to the long line of women that surround them, women who have carried the soul of the plantation on their shoulders. As tensions build and the weight of centuriesof ancestors and future generations to comeculminate in a climactic reckoning, The Prophets masterfully reveals the pain and suffering of inheritance, but is also shot through with hope, beauty, and truth, portraying the enormous, heroic power of love.","['Adult', 'Queer', 'LGBT', 'Romance', 'Literary Fiction', 'Race', 'African American', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1584823829i/52576333.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52576333-the-prophets,400.0,3.92,3558.0,The Prophets,20360.0

The only mortal in a family of gods, Medusa is the youngest of the Gorgon sisters. Unlike her siblings, Medusa grows older, experiences change, feels weakness. Her mortal lifespan gives her an urgency that her family will never know.When the sea god Poseidon assaults Medusa in Athene's temple, the goddess is enraged. Furious by the violation of her sacred space, Athene takes revenge--on the young woman. Punished for Poseidon's actions, Medusa is forever transformed. Writhing snakes replace her hair and her gaze will turn any living creature to stone. Cursed with the power to destroy all she loves with one look, Medusa condemns herself to a life of solitude.Until Perseus embarks upon a fateful quest to fetch the head of a Gorgon...In Stone Blind, classicist and comedian Natalie Haynes turns our understanding of this legendary myth on its head, bringing empathy and nuance to one of the earliest stories in which a woman--injured by a powerful man--is blamed, punished, and monstered for the assault. Delving into the origins of this mythic tale, Haynes revitalizes and reconstructs Medusa's story with her passion and fierce wit, offering a timely retelling of this classic myth that speaks to us today.","['Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Retellings', 'Feminism', 'Mythology', 'Greek Mythology', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1664995844i/61102615.jpg,0063258390,9780063258396,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61102615-stone-blind,373.0,3.85,6395.0,Stone Blind,43086.0

Sarah Polley,English,"Oscar-nominated screenwriter, director, and actor Sarah Polley's Run Towards the Danger explores memory and the dialogue between her past and her presentThese are the most dangerous stories of my life. The ones I have avoided, the ones I haven't told, the ones that have kept me awake on countless nights. As these stories found echoes in my adult life, and then went another, better way than they did in childhood, they became lighter and easier to carry.Sarah Polley's work as an actor, screenwriter, and director is celebrated for its honesty, complexity, and deep humanity. She brings all those qualities, along with her exquisite storytelling chops, to these six essays. Each one captures a piece of Polley's life as she remembers it, while at the same time examining the fallibility of memory, the mutability of reality in the mind, and the possibility of experiencing the past anew, as the person she is now but was not then. As Polley writes, the past and present are in a ""reciprocal pressure dance.""Polley contemplates stories from her own life ranging from stage fright to high-risk childbirth to endangerment and more. After struggling with the aftermath of a concussion, Polley met a specialist who gave her wholly new advice: to recover from a traumatic injury, she had to retrain her mind to strength by charging towards the very activities that triggered her symptoms. With riveting clarity, she shows the power of applying that same advice to other areas of her life in order to find a path forward, a way through. Rather than live in a protective crouch, she had to run towards the danger. 
  
In this extraordinary book, Polley explores what it is to live in one's body, in a constant state of becoming, learning, and changing.","['Womens', 'Audiobook', 'Essays', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir', 'Canada', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Mental Health', 'Autobiography']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1639378927i/58284103.jpg,0593300351,9780593300350,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58284103-run-towards-the-danger,272.0,4.34,1391.0,Run Towards the Danger: Confrontations with a Body of Memory,11381.0

In ""The Girl Who Did Not Know Fear,"" a professor with a delicate health condition becomes stranded for days in an airport hotel after a conference, desperate to get home to her wife and young daughter, and in acute danger of being late for an appointment that cannot be missed.

Lynn Casteel Harper,English,"For fans of Atul Gawandes Being Mortal, Eula Bisss On Immunity, and Paul Kalanithis When Breath Becomes Air, On Vanishing offers an essential, empathic exploration of dementia, and in the process asks searching questions about what it means to face our own inevitable vanishingAn estimated 50 million people in the world suffer from dementia. Diseases such as Alzheimers erase parts of ones memory but are also often said to erase the self. People dont simply die from such diseases; they are imagined, in the clichs of our era, as vanishing in plain sight, fading away, or enduring a long goodbye. In On Vanishing, Lynn Casteel Harper, a Baptist minister and nursing home chaplain, investigates the myths and metaphors surrounding dementia and aging, addressing not only the indignities caused by the condition but also by the rhetoric surrounding it. Harper asks essential questions about the nature of our outsize fear of dementia, the stigma this fear may create, and what it might mean for us all to try to vanish well.Weaving together personal stories with theology, history, philosophy, literature, and science, Harper confronts our elemental fears of disappearance and death, drawing on her own experiences with people with dementia both in the U.S. health-care system and within her own family. In the course of unpacking her own stories and encountersof leading a prayer group on a dementia unit; of meeting individuals dismissed as already gone and finding them still possessed of complex, vital inner lives; of witnessing her grandfathers final years with Alzheimers and discovering her own heightened genetic risk of succumbing to the diseaseHarper engages in an exploration of dementia that is unlike anything written before on the subject.Expanding our understanding of dementia beyond progressive vacancy and dread, On Vanishing makes room for beauty and hope, and opens a space in which we might start to consider better ways of caring for, and thinking about, our fellow human beings. It is a rich and startling work of nonfiction that reveals cognitive change as an essential aspect of what it means to be mortal.","['Audiobook', 'Psychology', 'Medicine', 'Memoir', 'Religion', 'Health', 'Death', 'Nonfiction', 'Medical', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1568661381l/51803274.jpg,,9781948226288,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51803274-on-vanishing,240.0,3.73,74.0,"On Vanishing: Mortality, Dementia, and What It Means to Disappear",438.0

I talk about my grandparents, doing stand-up comedy as a teenager, bar mitzvahs, and Jewish summer camp, and tell way more stories about doing drugs than my mother would like.

Kathryn Scanlan,English,"A collection of innovative and ambitious short stories from a visionary young literary artistIn The Dominant Animal--Kathryn Scanlan's adventurous, unsettling debut collection--compression is key. Sentences have been relentlessly trimmed, tuned, and teased for maximum impact, and a ferocious attention to rhythm and sound results in a palpable pulse of excitability and distress. The nature of love is questioned at a golf course, a flower shop, an all-you-can-eat buffet. The clay head of a man is bought and displayed as a trophy. Interior life manifests on the physical plane, where characters--human and animal--eat and breathe, provoke and injure one another.With exquisite control, Scanlan moves from expansive moods and fine afternoons to unease and violence--and also from deliberate and generative ambiguity to shocking, revelatory exactitude. Disturbances accrue as the collection progresses. How often the conclusions open--rather than tie--up. How they twist alertly. No mercy, a character says--and these stories are merciless and strange and absolutely masterful.","['Horror', 'Collections', 'Short Stories', 'American', 'The United States Of America', 'Contemporary', 'Anthologies', 'Literature', 'Fiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1559688456i/45892209.jpg,0374538298,9780374538293,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45892209-the-dominant-animal,144.0,3.59,107.0,The Dominant Animal,573.0

I order another bourbon, neat. This is the drink that will flip the switch. I dont even know how I got here, to this place, to this point. Something is happening to me lately. Im drinking too much. My sheets are soaking wet when I wake up from nightmares of decaying corpses. I order another drink and swig it, trying to forget about the latest case I cant shake.Crime-solving for me is more complex than the challenge of the hunt, or the process of piecing together a scientific puzzle. The thought of good people suffering drives me, for better or worse, to the point of obsession.People always ask how I am able to detach from the horrors of my work. Part of it is an innate capacity to compartmentalize; the rest is experience and exposure, and Ive had plenty of both. But I had always taken pride in the fact that I can keep my feelings locked up to get the job done. Its only been recently that it feels like all that suppressed darkness is beginning to seep out.When I look back at my long career, there is a lot I am proud of. I have caught some of the most notorious killers of the twenty-first century and brought justice and closure for their victims and families. I want to tell you about a lifetime solving these cold cases, from Laci Peterson to Jaycee Dugard to the Pittsburg homicides to, yes, my twenty-year-long hunt for the Golden State Killer.But a deeper question eats at me as I ask myself, at what cost? I have sacrificed relationships, joyeven fatherhoodbecause the pursuit of evil always came first. Did I make the right choice? Its something I grapple with every day. Yet as I stand in the spot where a young girl took her last breath, as I look into the eyes of her family, I know that, for me, there has never been a choice. I dont know if I can solve your case, I whisper. But I promise I will do my best.It is a promise I know I can keep.","['Crime', 'History', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir', 'Mystery', 'Biography', 'True Crime', 'Nonfiction', 'Adult']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1687444591i/57693618.jpg,1250622794,9781250622792,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57693618-unmasked,288.0,4.1,2836.0,Unmasked: My Life Solving America's Cold Cases,24389.0

But despite the rumors of their romance, Hades and Persephone have plenty to navigate on their own.Since coming to Olympus, Persephone has struggled to be the perfect maiden goddess. Her attraction to Hades has only complicated the intense burden of the gods' expectations.

Jill  Watts,English,"In the early 20th century, most African Americans still lived in the South, disenfranchised, impoverished, terrorized by white violence, and denied the basic rights of citizenship. As the Democrats swept into the White House on a wave of black defectors from the Party of Lincoln, a group of African American intellectuals--legal minds, social scientists, media folk--sought to get the community's needs on the table. This would become the Black Cabinet, a group of African American racial affairs experts working throughout the New Deal, forming an unofficial advisory council to lobby the President. But with the white Southern vote so important to the fortunes of the Party, the path would be far from smooth.Most prominent in the Black Cabinet were Mary McLeod Bethune, an educator close to Eleanor Roosevelt, and her ""boys"" Robert Weaver, a Harvard-educated economist who pioneered enforcement standards for federal anti-discrimination guidelines (and, years later, the first African American Cabinet secretary); Bill Hastie, a lawyer who would become a federal appellate judge; Al Smith, head of the largest black jobs program in the New Deal at the WPA; and Robert Vann, a newspaper publisher whose unstinting reporting on the administration's shortcomings would keep his erstwhile colleagues honest. Ralph Bunche, Walter White of the NAACP, A. Philip Randolph, and others are part of the story as well. But the Black Cabinet was never officially recognized by FDR, and with the demise of the New Deal, it disappeared from history.Jill Watts's The Black Cabinet is a dramatic full-scale examination of a forgotten moment that speaks directly to our own.","['History', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Social Justice', 'Presidents', 'Race', 'Biography', 'African American', 'American History', 'Nonfiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1568907642l/52746469.jpg,0802129102,9780802129109,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52746469-the-black-cabinet,560.0,4.12,93.0,The Black Cabinet: The Untold Story of African Americans and Politics During the Age of Roosevelt,296.0

Matthew Desmond,English,"The Pulitzer Prizewinning, bestselling author of Evicted reimagines the debate on poverty, making a new and bracing argument about why it persists in America: because the rest of us benefit from it. ONE OF THE MOST ANTICIPATED BOOKS OF 2023: The Washington Post, Time, Esquire, Newsweek, Minneapolis Star Tribune, Elle, Salon, Lit Hub, Kirkus ReviewsThe United States, the richest country on earth, has more poverty than any other advanced democracy. Why? Why does this land of plenty allow one in every eight of its children to go without basic necessities, permit scores of its citizens to live and die on the streets, and authorize its corporations to pay poverty wages?  In this landmark book, acclaimed sociologist Matthew Desmond draws on history, research, and original reporting to show how affluent Americans knowingly and unknowingly keep poor people poor. Those of us who are financially secure exploit the poor, driving down their wages while forcing them to overpay for housing and access to cash and credit. We prioritize the subsidization of our wealth over the alleviation of poverty, designing a welfare state that gives the most to those who need the least. And we stockpile opportunity in exclusive communities, creating zones of concentrated riches alongside those of concentrated despair. Some lives are made small so that others may grow. Elegantly written and fiercely argued, this compassionate book gives us new ways of thinking about a morally urgent problem. It also helps us imagine solutions. Desmond builds a startlingly original and ambitious case for ending poverty. He calls on us all to become poverty abolitionists, engaged in a politics of collective belonging to usher in a new age of shared prosperity and, at last, true freedom.","['History', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Social Justice', 'Social Science', 'Poverty', 'Economics', 'Sociology', 'Nonfiction', 'Social Issues']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1665696294i/61358638.jpg,0593239911,9780593239919,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61358638-poverty-by-america,284.0,4.28,4866.0,"Poverty, by America",34581.0

James Nestor,English,"No matter what you eat, how much you exercise, how skinny or young or wise you are, none of it matters if you're not breathing properly.There is nothing more essential to our health and well-being than breathing: take air in, let it out, repeat twenty-five thousand times a day. Yet, as a species, humans have lost the ability to breathe correctly, with grave consequences.Journalist James Nestor travels the world to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it. The answers aren't found in pulmonology labs, as we might expect, but in the muddy digs of ancient burial sites, secret Soviet facilities, New Jersey choir schools, and the smoggy streets of Sao Paulo. Nestor tracks down men and women exploring the hidden science behind ancient breathing practices like Pranayama, Sudarshan Kriya, and Tummo and teams up with pulmonary tinkerers to scientifically test long-held beliefs about how we breathe.Modern research is showing us that making even slight adjustments to the way we inhale and exhale can jump-start athletic performance; rejuvenate internal organs; halt snoring, asthma, and autoimmune disease; and even straighten scoliotic spines. None of this should be possible, and yet it is.Drawing on thousands of years of medical texts and recent cutting-edge studies in pulmonology, psychology, biochemistry, and human physiology, Breath turns the conventional wisdom of what we thought we knew about our most basic biological function on its head.

"David Graeber, David Wengrow",English,"A dramatically new understanding of human history, challenging our most fundamental assumptions about social evolutionfrom the development of agriculture and cities to the origins of the state, democracy, and inequalityand revealing new possibilities for human emancipation.For generations, our remote ancestors have been cast as primitive and childlikeeither free and equal innocents, or thuggish and warlike. Civilization, we are told, could be achieved only by sacrificing those original freedoms or, alternatively, by taming our baser instincts. David Graeber and David Wengrow show how such theories first emerged in the eighteenth century as a conservative reaction to powerful critiques of European society posed by Indigenous observers and intellectuals. Revisiting this encounter has startling implications for how we make sense of human history today, including the origins of farming, property, cities, democracy, slavery, and civilization itself.Drawing on pathbreaking research in archaeology and anthropology, the authors show how history becomes a far more interesting place once we learn to throw off our conceptual shackles and perceive whats really there. If humans did not spend 95 percent of their evolutionary past in tiny bands of hunter-gatherers, what were they doing all that time? If agriculture, and cities, did not mean a plunge into hierarchy and domination, then what kinds of social and economic organization did they lead to? The answers are often unexpected, and suggest that the course of human history may be less set in stone, and more full of playful, hopeful possibilities, than we tend to assume.The Dawn of Everything fundamentally transforms our understanding of the human past and offers a path toward imagining new forms of freedom, new ways of organizing society. This is a monumental book of formidable intellectual range, animated by curiosity, moral vision, and a faith in the power of direct action.","['History', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Economics', 'Sociology', 'Archaeology', 'Philosophy', 'Anthropology', 'Nonfiction', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1617072525i/56269264.jpg,0374157359,9780374157357,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56269264-the-dawn-of-everything,692.0,4.2,2828.0,The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity,18614.0
Justin Cronin,English,"From the New York Times bestselling author of The Passage comes a riveting standalone novel about a group of survivors on a hidden island utopia--where the truth isn't what it seems.Founded by a mysterious genius, the archipelago of Prospera lies hidden from the horrors of a deteriorating outside world. In this island paradise, Prospera's lucky citizens enjoy long, fulfilling lives until the monitors embedded in their forearms, meant to measure their physical health and psychological well-being, fall below 10 percent. Then they retire themselves, embarking on a ferry ride to the island known as the Nursery, where their failing bodies are renewed, their memories are wiped clean, and they are readied to restart life afresh.Proctor Bennett, of the Department of Social Contracts, has a satisfying career as a ferryman, gently shepherding people through the retirement process--and, when necessary, enforcing it.

Orphaned, saved and cared for by adults coping with the chaos of Saigon in free-fall, they become children of the Vietnamese diaspora. Em is not a romance in any usual sense of the word, but it is a word whose homonymaimer, to loveresonates on every page, a book powered by love in the larger sense. A portrait of Vietnamese identity emerges that is wholly remarkable, honed in wartime violence that borders on genocide, and then by the ingenuity, sheer grit and intelligence of Vietnamese-Americans, Vietnamese-Canadians and other Vietnamese former refugees who go on to build some of the most powerful small business empires in the world. Em is a poetic story steeped in history, about those most impacted by the violence and their later accomplishments. In many ways, Em is perhaps Kim Thy's most personal book, the one in which she trusts her readers enough to share with them not only the pervasive love she feels but also the rage and the horror at what she and so many other children of the Vietnam War had to live through.Written in Kim Thy's trademark style, near to prose poetry, Em reveals her fascination with connection. Through the linked destinies of characters connected by birth and destiny, the novel zigzags between the rubber plantations of Indochina; daily life in Saigon during the war as people find ways to survive and help each other; Operation Babylift, which evacuated thousands of biracial orphans from Saigon in April 1975 at the end of the Vietnam War; and today's global nail polish and nail salon industry, largely driven by former Vietnamese refugeesand everything in between.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,English,"#1 on AMAZON, and a NEW YORK TIMES, WALL STREET JOURNAL, USA TODAY and PUBLISHERS WEEKLY NATIONAL BESTSELLERPharma-funded mainstream media has convinced millions of Americans that Dr. Anthony Fauci is a hero. He is anything but. As director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Dr. Anthony Fauci dispenses $6.1 billion in annual taxpayer-provided funding for scientific research, allowing him to dictate the subject, content, and outcome of scientific health research across the globe. Fauci uses the financial clout at his disposal to wield extraordinary influence over hospitals, universities, journals, and thousands of influential doctors and scientistswhose careers and institutions he has the power to ruin, advance, or reward. During more than a year of painstaking and meticulous research, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unearthed a shocking story that obliterates media spin on Dr. Fauci . . . and that will alarm every AmericanDemocrat or Republicanwho cares about democracy, our Constitution, and the future of our childrens health. The Real Anthony Fauci reveals how Americas Doctor launched his career during the early AIDS crisis by partnering with pharmaceutical companies to sabotage safe and effective off-patent therapeutic treatments for AIDS. Fauci orchestrated fraudulent studies, and then pressured US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulators into approving a deadly chemotherapy treatment he had good reason to know was worthless against AIDS. Fauci repeatedly violated federal laws to allow his Pharma partners to use impoverished and dark-skinned children as lab rats in deadly experiments with toxic AIDS and cancer chemotherapies. In early 2000, Fauci shook hands with Bill Gates in the library of Gates $147 million Seattle mansion, cementing a partnership that would aim to control an increasingly profitable $60 billion global vaccine enterprise with unlimited growth potential. Through funding leverage and carefully cultivated personal relationships with heads of state and leading media and social media institutions, the Pharma-Fauci-Gates alliance exercises dominion over global health policy. The Real Anthony Fauci details how Fauci, Gates, and their cohorts use their control of media outlets, scientific journals, key government and quasi-governmental agencies, global intelligence agencies, and influential scientists and physicians to flood the public with fearful propaganda about COVID-19 virulence and pathogenesis, and to muzzle debate and ruthlessly censor dissent.","['History', 'Politics', 'Medicine', 'Biography', 'Health', 'Conspiracy Theories', 'Nonfiction', 'Society', 'Medical', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1621215342i/58063409.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58063409-the-real-anthony-fauci,934.0,4.53,1064.0,"The Real Anthony Fauci: Bill Gates, Big Pharma, and the Global War on Democracy and Public Health",6485.0
David Zucchino,English,"From Pulitzer Prize winner, David Zucchino, comes a searing account of the Wilmington riot and coup of 1898, an extraordinary event unknown to most Americans.By the 1890s, Wilmington was North Carolina's largest city and a shining example of a mixed-race community. It was a bustling port city with a burgeoning African American middle class and a Fusionist government of Republicans and Populists that included black aldermen, police officers and magistrates. There were successful black-owned businesses and an African American newspaper, The Record. But across the state--and the South--white supremacist Democrats were working to reverse the advances made by former slaves and their progeny.In 1898, in response to a speech calling for white men to rise to the defense of Southern womanhood against the supposed threat of black predators, Alexander Manly, the outspoken young Record editor, wrote that some relationships between black men and white women were consensual. His editorial ignited outrage across the South, with calls to lynch Manly.But North Carolina's white supremacist Democrats had a different strategy. They were plotting to take back the state legislature in November ""by the ballot or bullet or both,"" and then use the Manly editorial to trigger a ""race riot"" to overthrow Wilmington's multi-racial government. Led by prominent citizens including Josephus Daniels, publisher of the state's largest newspaper, and former Confederate Colonel Alfred Moore Waddell, white supremacists rolled out a carefully orchestrated campaign that included raucous rallies, race-baiting editorials and newspaper cartoons, and sensational, fabricated news stories.With intimidation and violence, the Democrats suppressed the black vote and stuffed ballot boxes (or threw them out), to win control of the state legislature on November eighth. Two days later, more than 2,000 heavily armed Red Shirts swarmed through Wilmington, torching the Record office, terrorizing women and children, and shooting at least sixty black men dead in the streets. The rioters forced city officials to resign at gunpoint and replaced them with mob leaders. Prominent blacks--and sympathetic whites--were banished. Hundreds of terrified black families took refuge in surrounding swamps and forests.This brutal insurrection is a rare instance of a violent overthrow of an elected government in the U.S. It halted gains made by blacks and restored racism as official government policy, cementing white rule for another half century. It was not a ""race riot,"" as the events of November 1898 came to be known, but rather a racially motivated rebellion launched by white supremacists.In Wilmington's Lie, Zucchino uses contemporary newspaper accounts, diaries, letters and official communications to create a gripping and compelling narrative that weaves together individual stories of hate and fear and brutality. This is a dramatic and definitive account of a remarkable but forgotten chapter of American history.","['Crime', 'History', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Race', 'True Crime', 'African American', 'American History', 'Nonfiction', 'Historical']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1571117991l/51243325.jpg,0802128386,9780802128386,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51243325-wilmington-s-lie,426.0,4.43,674.0,Wilmington's Lie: The Murderous Coup of 1898 and the Rise of White Supremacy,3567.0
Merlin Sheldrake,English,"There is a lifeform so strange and wondrous that it forces us to rethink how life worksNeither plant nor animal, it is found throughout the earth, the air and our bodies. It can be microscopic, yet also accounts for the largest organisms ever recorded, living for millennia and weighing tens of thousands of tonnes. Its ability to digest rock enabled the first life on land, it can survive unprotected in space, and thrives amidst nuclear radiation.In this captivating adventure, Merlin Sheldrake explores the spectacular and neglected world of fungi: endlessly surprising organisms that sustain nearly all living systems. They can solve problems without a brain, stretching traditional definitions of intelligence, and can manipulate animal behaviour with devastating precision. In giving us bread, alcohol and life-saving medicines, fungi have shaped human history, and their psychedelic properties, which have influenced societies since antiquity, have recently been shown to alleviate a number of mental illnesses. The ability of fungi to digest plastic, explosives, pesticides and crude oil is being harnessed in break-through technologies, and the discovery that they connect plants in underground networks, the Wood Wide Web, is transforming the way we understand ecosystems. Yet they live their lives largely out of sight, and over ninety percent of their species remain undocumented.Entangled Life is a mind-altering journey into this hidden kingdom of life, and shows that fungi are key to understanding the planet on which we live, and the ways we think, feel and behave. The more we learn about fungi, the less makes sense without them.","['History', 'Biology', 'Science Nature', 'Audiobook', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Environment', 'Nonfiction', 'Ecology', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1575341220l/52668915.jpg,0525510311,9780525510314,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52668915-entangled-life,352.0,4.36,4878.0,"Entangled Life: How Fungi Make Our Worlds, Change Our Minds & Shape Our Futures",35496.0

Ayanna Lloyd Banwo,English,"A mythic love story set in Trinidad and Tobago, Ayanna Lloyd Banwo's radiant debut introduces two unforgettable outsiders brought together by their connection with the dead. You were never the smartest child, but even you should know that when a dead woman offers you a cigarette, the polite thing to do would be to take it. Especially when that dead woman is your mother.The St. Bernard women have lived in Morne Marie, the house on top of a hill outside Port Angeles, for generations. Built from the ashes of a plantation that enslaved their ancestors, it has come to shelter a lineage that is bonded by much more than blood. One woman in each generation of St. Bernards is responsible for the passage of the city's souls into the afterlife. But Yejide's relationship with her mother, Petronella, has always been contorted by anger and neglect, which Petronella stubbornly carries to her death bed, leaving Yejide unprepared to fulfill her destiny.Raised in the countryside by a devout Rastafarian mother, Darwin has always abided by the religious commandment not to interact with death. He has never been to a funeral, much less seen a dead body. But when his ailing mother can no longer work and the only job he can find is grave digging, he must betray the life she built for him in order to provide for them both. Newly shorn of his dreadlocks and his past and determined to prove himself, Darwin finds himself adrift in a city electric with possibility and danger.Yejide and Darwin will meet inside the gates of Fidelis, Port Angeles's largest and oldest cemetery, where the dead lie uneasy in their graves and a reckoning with fate beckons them both. A masterwork of lush imagination and immersive lyricism, When We Were Birds is a spellbinding novel about inheritance, loss, and love's seismic power to heal.","['Paranormal', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Magical Realism', 'Romance', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Adult']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1629822465i/58065031.jpg,0385547269,9780385547260,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58065031-when-we-were-birds,292.0,3.8,1174.0,When We Were Birds,6969.0

"Lisa Kudrow, Matthew  Perry",English,"Hi, my name is Matthew, although you may know me by another name. My friends call me Matty. And I should be dead.So begins the riveting story of acclaimed actor Matthew Perry, taking us along on his journey from childhood ambition to fame to addiction and recovery in the aftermath of a life-threatening health scare. Before the frequent hospital visits and stints in rehab, there was five-year-old Matthew, who traveled from Montreal to Los Angeles, shuffling between his separated parents; fourteen-year-old Matthew, who was a nationally ranked tennis star in Canada; twenty-four-year-old Matthew, who nabbed a coveted role as a lead cast member on the talked-about pilot then called Friends Like Us. . . and so much more.In an extraordinary story that only he could telland in the heartfelt, hilarious, and warmly familiar way only he could tell itMatthew Perry lays bare the fractured family that raised him (and also left him to his own devices), the desire for recognition that drove him to fame, and the void inside him that could not be filled even by his greatest dreams coming true. But he also details the peace hes found in sobriety and how he feels about the ubiquity of Friends, sharing stories about his castmates and other stars he met along the way. Frank, self-aware, and with his trademark humor, Perry vividly depicts his lifelong battle with addiction and what fueled it despite seemingly having it all.Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing is an unforgettable memoir that is both intimate and eye-openingas well as a hand extended to anyone struggling with sobriety.

Michael J. Fox,English,"INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERA moving account of resilience, hope, fear and mortality, and how these things resonate in our lives, by actor and advocate Michael J. Fox.The entire world knows Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly, the teenage sidekick of Doc Brown in Back to the Future; as Alex P. Keaton in Family Ties; as Mike Flaherty in Spin City; and through numerous other movie roles and guest appearances on shows such as The Good Wife and Curb Your Enthusiasm. Diagnosed at age 29, Michael is equally engaged in Parkinson's advocacy work, raising global awareness of the disease and helping find a cure through The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, the world's leading non-profit funder of PD science. His two previous bestselling memoirs, Lucky Man and Always Looking Up, dealt with how he came to terms with the illness, all the while exhibiting his iconic optimism. His new memoir reassesses this outlook, as events in the past decade presented additional challenges.In No Time Like the Future: An Optimist Considers Mortality, Michael shares personal stories and observations about illness and health, aging, the strength of family and friends, and how our perceptions about time affect the way we approach mortality. Thoughtful and moving, but with Fox's trademark sense of humor, his book provides a vehicle for reflection about our lives, our loves, and our losses.Running through the narrative is the drama of the medical madness Fox recently experienced, that included his daily negotiations with the Parkinson's disease he's had since 1991, and a spinal cord issue that necessitated immediate surgery. His challenge to learn how to walk again, only to suffer a devastating fall, nearly caused him to ditch his trademark optimism and ""get out of the lemonade business altogether.""Does he make it all of the way back?

Lulu Miller,English,"A wondrous debut from an extraordinary new voice in nonfiction, Why Fish Dont Exist is a dark and astonishing tale of love, chaos, scientific obsession, andpossiblyeven murder. David Starr Jordan was a taxonomist, a man possessed with bringing order to the natural world. In time, he would be credited with discovering nearly a fifth of the fish known to humans in his day. But the more of the hidden blueprint of life he uncovered, the harder the universe seemed to try to thwart him. His specimen collections were demolished by lightning, by fire, and eventually by the 1906 San Francisco earthquakewhich sent more than a thousand of his discoveries, housed in fragile glass jars, plummeting to the floor. In an instant, his lifes work was shattered. Many might have given up, given in to despair. But Jordan? He surveyed the wreckage at his feet, found the first fish he recognized, and confidently began to rebuild his collection. And this time, he introduced one clever innovation that he believed would at last protect his work against the chaos of the world. When NPR reporter Lulu Miller first heard this anecdote in passing, she took Jordan for a foola cautionary tale in hubris, or denial. But as her own life slowly unraveled, she began to wonder about him. Perhaps instead he was a model for how to go on when all seemed lost. What she would unearth about his life would transform her understanding of history, morality, and the world beneath her feet. Part biography, part memoir, part scientific adventure, Why Fish Dont Exist reads like a fable about how to persevere in a world where chaos will always prevail.","['History', 'Animals', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir', 'Nature', 'Biography', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1565526670i/50887097.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50887097-why-fish-don-t-exist,225.0,4.16,6222.0,"Why Fish Don’t Exist: A Story of Loss, Love, and the Hidden Order of Life",39445.0

Drawing on his understanding of innovation and what it takes to get new ideas into the market, he describes the areas in which technology is already helping to reduce emissions, where and how the current technology can be made to function more effectively, where breakthrough technologies are needed, and who is working on these essential innovations. Finally, he lays out a concrete, practical plan for achieving the goal of zero emissions-suggesting not only policies that governments should adopt, but what we as individuals can do to keep our government, our employers, and ourselves accountable in this crucial enterprise.As Bill Gates makes clear, achieving zero emissions will not be simple or easy to do, but if we follow the plan he sets out here, it is a goal firmly within our reach.","['Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Sustainability', 'Technology', 'Climate Change', 'Economics', 'Business', 'Environment', 'Nonfiction', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1609355352i/52275335.jpg,0241448301,9780241448304,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52275335-how-to-avoid-a-climate-disaster,272.0,4.13,4759.0,How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need,46412.0

Dave  Rubin,English,"The Progressive Woke Machine--from outrage mobs and online censorship to activists masquerading as journalists--is waging war against the last free thinkers in the world. This book is both an explanation of the current political upheaval and your guide to surviving it.America, and the West in general, is in the midst of an identity crisis that's headed towards an outright revolution. The progressive left, once the advocates of free expression and individual autonomy, now undermine these values at every turn. This uncomfortable truth has turned moderates and true liberals into the politically homeless class. In response, Dave Rubin launched his political talk show The Rubin Report in 2015 as a laboratory for anyone trying to make sense of our shifting political landscape. He discusses the most controversial issues of the day with people he both agrees and disagrees with, including those who have been dismissed, deplatformed, and even despised before they've had a chance to speak for themselves. Based on his own story as well as his experiences from the front lines of the free speech wars, this book will inspire you to make up your own mind about what you believe on any issue, and show you how to: * Check your facts, not your privilege: No matter your gender, economic class, or level of education, you're still allowed to have opinions (for now!). Rubin separates facts from feelings, dispelling today's most pervasive myths, like the wage gap, gun violence, racism, affirmative action, climate change, hate crimes, and more.  * Learn to stand your ground: A difference of opinion should not be a deal-breaker for any relationship, professional or personal. Sadly, these days, it often is. Rubin will show you that losing a few friends is a small price to pay for standing up for what you believe in--and why choosing an authentic path is ultimately worth it. * Defend liberalism while you still can: Time is running out to defend individual rights, limited government, and free expression. Rubin provides a roadmap for true classically liberal principles regardless of your party affiliation, and shows you why freedom is impossible without them. Don't Burn This Book empowers you with time-tested and common-sense principles that can turn the tide against authoritarians on both sides in this increasingly polarized world. This book is a rallying cry for anyone who wants to live freely, which is quickly becoming the most radical belief you could have.","['Politics', 'Self Help', 'Audiobook', 'Psychology', 'Cultural', 'Sociology', 'Philosophy', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Society']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1564527048i/49907457.jpg,0593084292,9780593084298,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49907457-don-t-burn-this-book,256.0,3.77,575.0,Don’t Burn This Book: Thinking for Yourself in an Age of Unreason,3669.0

Anne Applebaum,English,"The Pulitzer Prize-winning author, professor, and historian offers an expert guide to understanding the appeal of the strongman as a leader and an explanation for why authoritarianism is back with a menacing twenty-first century twist.Across the world today, from the Americas to Europe and beyond, liberal democracy is under siege while populism and nationalism are on the rise. In Twilight of Democracy, prize-winning historian Anne Applebaum offers an unexpected explanation: that there is a deep and inherent appeal to authoritarianism, to strongmen, and, especially, to one-party rule--that is, to political systems that benefit true believers, or loyal soldiers, or simply the friends and distant cousins of the Leader, to the exclusion of everyone else.People, she argues, are not just ideological; they are also practical, pragmatic, opportunistic. They worry about their families, their houses, their careers. Some political systems offer them possibilities, and others don't. In particular, the modern authoritarian parties that have arisen within democracies today offer the possibility of success to people who do not thrive in the meritocratic, democratic, or free-market competition that determines access to wealth and power.Drawing on reporting in Spain, Switzerland, Poland, Hungary, and Brazil; using historical examples including Stalinist central Europe and Nazi Germany; and investigating related phenomena: the modern conspiracy theory, nostalgia for a golden past, political polarization, and meritocracy and its discontents, Anne Applebaum brilliantly illuminates the seduction of totalitarian thinking and the eternal appeal of the one-party state.","['History', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Sociology', 'The United States Of America', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Society', 'Poland', 'Political Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1577773311i/50155421.jpg,0771005857,9780771005855,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50155421-twilight-of-democracy,224.0,3.91,1701.0,Twilight of Democracy: The Seductive Lure of Authoritarianism,13854.0

But behind her office door she was having panic attacks and sobbing at her desk. After years of questioning what was wrong with her, she was diagnosed with Complex PTSD--a condition that occurs when trauma happens continuously, over the course of years.Both of Stephanie's parents had abandoned her as a teenager after years of physical and verbal abuse and neglect. She thought she'd overcome her trauma, but her diagnosis illuminated the ways in which her past continued to threaten her health, her relationships, and her career.

Lesley Hamlyn and her husband, Robert, a lawyer and war veteran, are living at Cassowary House on the Straits Settlement of Penang. When Willie Somerset Maugham, a famed writer and old friend of Robert's, arrives for an extended visit with his secretary Gerald, the pair threatens a rift that could alter more lives than one.Maugham, one of the great novelists of his day, is beleaguered: Having long hidden his homosexuality, his unhappy and expensive marriage of convenience becomes unbearable after he loses his savings-and the freedom to travel with Gerald. His career deflating, his health failing, Maugham arrives at Cassowary House in desperate need of a subject for his next book. Lesley, too, is enduring a marriage more duplicitous than it first appears. Maugham suspects an affair, and, learning of Lesley's past connection to the Chinese revolutionary, Dr. Sun Yat Sen, decides to probe deeper. But as their friendship grows and Lesley confides in him about life in the Straits, Maugham discovers a far more surprising tale than he imagined, one that involves not only war and scandal but the trial of an Englishwoman charged with murder. It is, to Maugham, a story worthy of fiction.A mesmerizingly beautiful novel based on real events, The House of Doors traces the fault lines of race, gender, sexuality, and power under empire, and dives deep into the complicated nature of love and friendship in its shadow.","['Novels', 'Asian Literature', 'Audiobook', 'Queer', 'LGBT', 'Literary Fiction', 'Historical', 'Fiction', 'Asia', 'Historical Fiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1698331937i/65215270.jpg,1639731938,9781639731930,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65215270-the-house-of-doors,320.0,4.15,1323.0,The House of Doors,9187.0

Abigail Shrier,English,"
  Irreversible Damage
 is an exploration of a mystery: Why, in the last decade, has the diagnosis ""gender dysphoria,"" transformed from a vanishingly rare affliction, applying almost exclusively to boys and men, to an epidemic among teenage girls?  Author Abigail Shrier presents shocking statistics and stories from real families to show that America and the West have become fertile ground for a ""transgender craze"" that has nothing to do with real gender dysphoria and everything to do with our cultural frailty.

Its late 2016 when Ariel discovers that her mother Monas animal sanctuary in Western Kansas has not only been the target of anti-Semitic hate crimesbut that its also for sale, due to hidden financial ruin. Ariel, living a new life in progressive Lawrence, and estranged from her mother for six long years, knows she has to return to her childhood homeespecially since her own past may have played a role in the attack on the sanctuary. Ariel expects tension, maybe even fury, but she doesnt anticipate that her first love, a ranch hand named Gideon, will still be working at the Bright Side. Back in Lawrence, Ariels charming but hapless fianc, Dex, grows paranoid about her sudden departure. After uncovering Monas address, he sets out to confront Ariel, but instead finds her grappling with the life shes abandoned. Amid the reparations with her mother, its clear that Ariel is questioning the meaning of her life in Lawrence, and whether she belongs with Dex or with someone else, somewhere else.

Chuck Klosterman,English,"The Nineties: a wise and funny reckoning with the decade that gave us slacker/grunge irony about the sin of trying too hard, during the greatest shift in human consciousness of any decade in American history. It was long ago, but not as long as it seems: The Berlin Wall fell and the Twin Towers collapsed. In between, one presidential election was allegedly decided by Ross Perot while another was plausibly decided by Ralph Nader. In the beginning, almost every name and address was listed in a phone book, and everyone answered their landlines because you didn't know who it was. By the end, exposing someone's address was an act of emotional violence, and nobody picked up their new cell phone if they didn't know who it was. The '90s brought about a revolution in the human condition we're still groping to understand. Happily, Chuck Klosterman is more than up to the job. Beyond epiphenomena like Cop Killer and Titanic and Zima, there were wholesale shifts in how society was perceived: the rise of the internet, pre-9/11 politics, and the paradoxical belief that nothing was more humiliating than trying too hard. Pop culture accelerated without the aid of a machine that remembered everything, generating an odd comfort in never being certain about anything. On a '90s Thursday night, more people watched any random episode of Seinfeld than the finale of Game of Thrones. But nobody thought that was important; if you missed it, you simply missed it. It was the last era that held to the idea of a true, hegemonic mainstream before it all began to fracture, whether you found a home in it or defined yourself against it. In The Nineties, Chuck Klosterman makes a home in all of it: the film, the music, the sports, the TV, the politics, the changes regarding race and class and sexuality, the yin/yang of Oprah and Alan Greenspan. In perhaps no other book ever written would a sentence like, ""The video for 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' was not more consequential than the reunification of Germany"" make complete sense. Chuck Klosterman has written a multi-dimensional masterpiece, a work of synthesis so smart and delightful that future historians might well refer to this entire period as Klostermanian.","['History', 'Politics', 'Cultural', 'Audiobook', 'Essays', 'Sociology', 'Music', 'Pop Culture', 'Nonfiction', 'Historical']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1695136161i/58082714.jpg,0735217955,9780735217959,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58082714-the-nineties,370.0,3.88,3248.0,The Nineties,25351.0

Mr. Lloyd takes the last leg by currach, though boats with engines are available and he doesn't much like the sea. He wants the authentic experience, to be changed by this place, to let its quiet and light fill him, give him room to create. He doesn't know that a Frenchman follows close behind.

As a writer, Ann Patchett knows what the outcome of her fiction will be. Life, however, often takes turns we do not see coming. Patchett ponders this truth in these wise essays that afford a fresh and intimate look into her mind and heart.At the center of These Precious Days is the title essay, a suprising and moving meditation on an unexpected friendship that explores what it means to be seen, to find someone with whom you can be your best and most complete self. When Patchett chose an early galley of actor and producer Tom Hanks short story collection to read one night before bed, she had no idea that this single choice would be life changing.

Jeff Shaara,English,"The New York Times bestselling master of military historical fiction tells the story of Pearl Harbor as only he can in the first novel of a gripping new series set in World War IIs Pacific theater. In 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt watches uneasily as the world heads rapidly down a dangerous path. The Japanese have waged an aggressive campaign against China, and they now begin to expand their ambitions to other parts of Asia. As their expansion efforts grow bolder, their enemies know that Japans ultimate goal is total conquest over the region, especially when the Japanese align themselves with Hitlers Germany and Mussolinis Italy, who wage their own war of conquest across Europe. Meanwhile, the British stand nearly alone against Hitler, and there is pressure in Washington to transfer Americas powerful fleet of warships from Hawaii to the Atlantic to join the fight against German U-boats that are devastating shipping. But despite deep concerns about weakening the Pacific fleet, no one believes that the main base at Pearl Harbor is under any real threat. Told through the eyes of widely diverse characters, this story looks at all sides of the drama and puts the reader squarely in the middle. In Washington, Secretary of State Cordell Hull must balance his own concerns between President Roosevelt and the Japanese ambassador, Kichisaburo Nomura, who is little more than a puppet of his own government. In Japan, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto wins skeptical approval for his outrageous plans in the Pacific, yet he understands more than anyone that an attack on Pearl Harbor will start a war that Japan cannot win. In Hawaii, Commander Joseph Rocheforts job as an accomplished intelligence officer is to decode radio signals and detect the location of the Japanese fleet, but when the airwaves suddenly go silent, no one has any idea why. And from a small Depression-ravaged town, nineteen-year-old Tommy Biggs sees the Navy as his chance to escape and happily accepts his assignment, every sailors dream: the battleship USS Arizona. With you-are-there immediacy, Shaara opens up the mysteries of just how Japana small, deeply militarist nationcould launch one of historys most devastating surprise attacks. In this story of innocence, heroism, sacrifice, and unfathomable blindness, Shaaras gift for storytelling uses these familiar wartime themes to shine a light on the personal, the painful, the tragic, and the thrillingand on a crucial part of history we must never forget.","['World War II', 'Audiobook', 'War', 'Military History', 'Adult Fiction', 'American History', 'Military Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1568048033l/52956654.jpg,0593129636,9780593129630,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52956654-to-wake-the-giant,524.0,4.43,385.0,To Wake the Giant: A Novel of Pearl Harbor,3499.0

Clint   Smith,English,"Poet and contributor to The Atlantic Clint Smiths revealing, contemporary portrait of America as a slave owning nation Beginning in his own hometown of New Orleans, Clint Smith leads the reader through an unforgettable tour of monuments and landmarks-those that are honest about the past and those that are not-that offer an intergenerational story of how slavery has been central in shaping our nation's collective history, and ourselves. It is the story of the Monticello Plantation in Virginia, the estate where Thomas Jefferson wrote letters espousing the urgent need for liberty while enslaving over 400 people on the premises. It is the story of the Whitney Plantation, one of the only former plantations devoted to preserving the experience of the enslaved people whose lives and work sustained it. It is the story of Angola Prison in Louisiana, a former plantation named for the country from which most of its enslaved people arrived and which has since become one of the most gruesome maximum-security prisons in the world. And it is the story of Blandford Cemetery, the final resting place of tens of thousands of Confederate soldiers. In a deeply researched and transporting exploration of the legacy of slavery and its imprint on centuries of American history, How the Word Is Passed illustrates how some of our country's most essential stories are hidden in plain view-whether in places we might drive by on our way to work, holidays such as Juneteenth, or entire neighborhoodslike downtown Manhattanon which the brutal history of the trade in enslaved men, women and children has been deeply imprinted. Informed by scholarship and brought alive by the story of people living today, Clint Smiths debut work of nonfiction is a landmark work of reflection and insight that offers a new understanding of the hopeful role that memory and history can play in understanding our country.","['History', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Social Justice', 'Race', 'African American', 'American History', 'Nonfiction', 'Anti Racist', 'Historical']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1603917194i/55643287.jpg,0316492930,9780316492935,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55643287-how-the-word-is-passed,336.0,4.72,5209.0,How the Word Is Passed: A Reckoning with the History of Slavery Across America,33188.0

Evidence has shown that creative geniuses are not attached to one identity, but constantly willing to rethink their stances and that leaders who admit they don't know something and seek critical feedback lead more productive and innovative teams.New evidence shows us that as a mindset and a skilllset, rethinking can be taught and Grant explains how to develop the necessary qualities to do it. Section 1 explores why we struggle to think again and how we can learn to do it as individuals, arguing that 'grit' alone can actually be counterproductive. Section 2 discusses how we can help others think again through learning about 'argument literacy'. And the final section 3 looks at how schools, businesses and governments fall short in building cultures that encourage rethinking.In the end, learning to rethink may be the secret skill to give you the edge in a world changing faster than ever.","['Self Help', 'Audiobook', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Education', 'Leadership', 'Business', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1602574232i/55539565.jpg,1984878107,9781984878106,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55539565-think-again,307.0,4.21,7430.0,Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don't Know,99493.0

Clare Beams,English,"The year is 1871. In Ashwell, Massachusetts, at the farm of Samuel Hood and his daughter Caroline, a mysterious flock of red birds descends. Samuel, whose fame as a philosopher has waned in recent years, takes the birds' appearance as an omen that the time is ripe for his newest venture. He will start a school for young women, guiding their intellectual development as he has so carefully guided his daughter's. Despite Caroline's misgivings, Samuel's vision--revolutionary, as always; noble, as always; full of holes, as always--takes shape.It's not long before the students begin to manifest bizarre symptoms. Rashes, fits, headaches, verbal tics, night wanderings. In desperation, the school turns to the ministering of a sinister physician--based on a real historic treatment--just as Caroline's body, too, begins its betrayal. As the girls' conditions worsens, long-buried secrets emerge, and Caroline must confront the all-male, all-knowing authorities around her, the ones who insist the voices of the sufferers are unreliable. In order to save herself, Caroline may have to destroy everything she's ever known.Written in intensely vivid prose and brimming with psychological insight, The Illness Lesson is a powerful exploration of women's bodies, women's minds, and the time-honored tradition of doubting both.","['Novels', 'Adult', 'Magical Realism', 'Mystery', 'Literary Fiction', 'Adult Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1561686503i/45754743.jpg,0385544669,9780385544665,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45754743-the-illness-lesson,288.0,3.27,452.0,The Illness Lesson,2779.0

Natalie Daz,English,"Natalie Diazs highly anticipated follow-up to When My Brother Was an Aztec, winner of an American Book AwardPostcolonial Love Poem is an anthem of desire against erasure. Natalie Diazs brilliant second collection demands that every body carried in its pagesbodies of language, land, rivers, suffering brothers, enemies, and loversbe touched and held as beloveds. Through these poems, the wounds inflicted by America onto an indigenous people are allowed to bloom pleasure and tenderness: Let me call my anxiety, desire, then. / Let me call it, a garden. In this new lyrical landscape, the bodies of indigenous, Latinx, black, and brown women are simultaneously the body politic and the body ecstatic. In claiming this autonomy of desire, language is pushed to its dark edges, the astonishing dunefields and forests where pleasure and love are both grief and joy, violence and sensuality.Diaz defies the conditions from which she writes, a nation whose creation predicated the diminishment and ultimate erasure of bodies like hers and the people she loves: I am doing my best to not become a museum / of myself. I am doing my best to breathe in and out. // I am begging: Let me be lonely but not invisible.

Malcolm Gladwell,English,"An exploration of how technology and best intentions collide in the heat of warANew York Times Book Review Editors ChoiceIn The Bomber Mafia, Malcolm Gladwell weaves together the stories of a Dutch genius and his homemade computer, a band of brothers in central Alabama, a British psychopath, and pyromaniacal chemists at Harvard to examine one of the greatest moral challenges in modern American history.Most military thinkers in the years leading up to World War II saw the airplane as an afterthought. But a small band of idealistic strategists, the Bomber Mafia, asked: What if precision bombing could cripple the enemy and make war far less lethal? In contrast, the bombing of Tokyo on the deadliest night of the war was the brainchild of General Curtis LeMay, whose brutal pragmatism and scorched-earth tactics in Japan cost thousands of civilian lives, but may have spared even more by averting a planned US invasion. In The Bomber Mafia, Gladwell asks, Was it worth it?Things might have gone differently had LeMays predecessor, General Haywood Hansell, remained in charge. Hansell believed in precision bombing, but when he and Curtis LeMay squared off for a leadership handover in the jungles of Guam, LeMay emerged victorious, leading to the darkest night of World War II.

Kentucky, 1850. An enslaved groom named Jarret and a bay foal forge a bond of understanding that will carry the horse to record-setting victories across the South. When the nation erupts in civil war, an itinerant young artist who has made his name on paintings of the racehorse takes up arms for the Union.

Lauren  Hough,English,"Searing and extremely personal essays from the heart of working-class America, shot through with the darkest elements the country can manifest--cults, homelessness, and hunger--while discovering light and humor in unexpected corners.As an adult, Lauren Hough has had many identities: an airman in the U.S. Air Force, a cable guy, a bouncer at a gay club. As a child, however, she had none. Growing up as a member of the infamous cult The Children of God, Hough had her own self robbed from her. The cult took her all over the globe--to Germany, Japan, Texas, Ecuador--but it wasn't until her mother finally walked away that Lauren understood she could have a life beyond ""The Family.""Along the way, she's loaded up her car and started over, trading one life for the next. She's taken pilgrimages to the sights of her youth, been kept in solitary confinement, dated a lot of women, dabbled in drugs, and eventually found herself as what she always wanted to be: a writer. Here, as she sweeps through the underbelly of America--relying on friends, family, and strangers alike--she begins to excavate a new identity even as her past continues to trail her and color her world, relationships, and perceptions of self.At once razor-sharp, profoundly brave, and often very, very funny, the essays in Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing interrogate our notions of ecstasy, queerness, and what it means to live freely. Each piece is a reckoning: of survival, identity, and how to reclaim one's past when carving out a future.","['Audiobook', 'Queer', 'Essays', 'Memoir', 'LGBT', 'Religion', 'Feminism', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Cults']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1596692519i/54831125.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54831125-leaving-isn-t-the-hardest-thing,314.0,3.38,1700.0,Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,10012.0

Torrey Peters,English,"
  A whipsmart debut about three very different women--transgender and cisgender--whose lives collide after an unexpected pregnancy forces them to confront their deepest desires around gender, motherhood, and sex
Reese almost had it all: a loving relationship with Amy, an apartment in New York City, a job she didn't hate. She had scraped together what previous generations of trans women could only dream of: a life of mundane, bourgeois comforts. The only thing missing was a child. But then her girlfriend, Amy, detransitioned and became Ames, and everything fell apart. Now Reese is caught in a self-destructive pattern: avoiding her loneliness by sleeping with married men. Ames isn't happy either. He thought detransitioning to live as a man would make life easier, but that decision cost him his relationship with Reese--and losing her meant losing his only family. Even though their romance is over, he longs to find a way back to her. When Ames's boss and lover, Katrina, reveals that she's pregnant with his baby--and that she's not sure whether she wants to keep it--Ames wonders if this is the chance he's been waiting for. Could the three of them form some kind of unconventional family--and raise the baby together? This provocative debut is about what happens at the emotional, messy, vulnerable corners of womanhood that platitudes and good intentions can't reach. Torrey Peters brilliantly and fearlessly navigates the most dangerous taboos around gender, sex, and relationships, gifting us a thrillingly original, witty, and deeply moving novel.","['Novels', 'Gender', 'Audiobook', 'Queer', 'LGBT', 'Literary Fiction', 'Transgender', 'Contemporary', 'Fiction', 'Adult']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1588535575i/50240841.jpg,0593133390,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50240841-detransition-baby,352.0,3.95,9578.0,"Detransition, Baby",77462.0

Lauren Groff,English,"Lauren Groff returns with her exhilarating first new novel since the groundbreaking Fates and Furies.Cast out of the royal court by Eleanor of Aquitaine, deemed too coarse and rough-hewn for marriage or courtly life, 17-year-old Marie de France is sent to England to be the new prioress of an impoverished abbey, its nuns on the brink of starvation and beset by disease.At first taken aback by the severity of her new life, Marie finds focus and love in collective life with her singular and mercurial sisters. In this crucible, Marie steadily supplants her desire for family, for her homeland, for the passions of her youth with something new to her: devotion to her sisters, and a conviction in her own divine visions. Marie, born the last in a long line of women warriors and crusaders, is determined to chart a bold new course for the women she now leads and protects. But in a world that is shifting and corroding in frightening ways, one that can never reconcile itself with her existence, will the sheer force of Marie's vision be bulwark enough?Equally alive to the sacred and the profane, Matrix gathers currents of violence, sensuality, and religious ecstasy in a mesmerizing portrait of consuming passion, aberrant faith, and a woman that history moves both through and around. Lauren Groff's new novel, her first since Fates and Furies, is a defiant and timely exploration of the raw power of female creativity in a corrupted world.","['Novels', 'Audiobook', 'Queer', 'LGBT', 'Literary Fiction', 'Religion', 'Feminism', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1617287438i/57185348.jpg,1594634491,9781594634499,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57185348-matrix,260.0,3.68,7761.0,Matrix,56912.0

In this coming-of-age memoir told through the themes of great books such as The Metamorphosis, The Scarlet Letter, The Iliad, and more, Tran navigates the push and pull of finding and accepting himself despite the challenges of immigration, feelings of isolation, and teenage rebellion, all while attempting to meet the rigid expectations set by his immigrant parents.Appealing to fans of coming-of-age memoirs such as Fresh Off the Boat, Running with Scissors, or tales of assimilation like Viet Thanh Nguyen's The Displaced and The Refugees, Sigh, Gone explores one mans bewildering experiences of abuse, racism, and tragedy and reveals redemption and connection in books and punk rock.

When existential threatsfrom climate change and economic precariousness to the rise of an unnamed dictator and an epidemic of lonelinessbegin to loom, she posts her way deeper into the portal's void. An avalanche of images, details, and references accumulate to form a landscape that is post-sense, post-irony, post-everything. ""Are we in hell?"" the people of the portal ask themselves. ""Are we all just going to keep doing this until we die?""Suddenly, two texts from her mother pierce the fray: ""Something has gone wrong,"" and ""How soon can you get here?""

Iris has spent most of her teenage years trying to avoid the weirdness that sticks to her like tar. But when her eldest sister, Grey, goes missing under suspicious circumstances, Iris learns just how weird her life can get: horned men start shadowing her, a corpse falls out of her sisters ceiling, and ugly, impossible memories start to twist their way to the forefront of her mind.

Curtis Sittenfeld,English,"From the New York Times bestselling author of American Wife and Eligible, a novel that imagines a deeply compelling what-might-have-been: What if Hillary Rodham hadnt married Bill Clinton? In 1971, Hillary Rodham is a young woman full of promise: Life magazine has covered her Wellesley commencement speech, shes attending Yale Law School, and shes on the forefront of student activism and the womens rights movement. And then she meets Bill Clinton. A handsome, charismatic southerner and fellow law student, Bill is already planning his political career. In each other, the two find a profound intellectual, emotional, and physical connection that neither has previously experienced. In the real world, Hillary followed Bill back to Arkansas, and he proposed several times; although she said no more than once, as we all know, she eventually accepted and became Hillary Clinton. But in Curtis Sittenfelds powerfully imagined tour-de-force of fiction, Hillary takes a different road. Feeling doubt about the prospective marriage, she endures their devastating breakup and leaves Arkansas. Over the next four decades, she blazes her own trailone that unfolds in public as well as in private, that involves crossing paths again (and again) with Bill Clinton, that raises questions about the tradeoffs all of us must make in building a life.

Stephen King,English,"Legendary storyteller Stephen King goes deep into the well of his imagination in this spellbinding novel about a seventeen-year-old boy who inherits the keys to a parallel world where good and evil are at war, and the stakes could not be higherfor their world or ours. Charlie Reade looks like a regular high school kid, great at baseball and football, a decent student. But he carries a heavy load. His mom was killed in a hit-and-run accident when he was ten, and grief drove his dad to drink. Charlie learned how to take care of himselfand his dad. Then, when Charlie is seventeen, he meets Howard Bowditch, a recluse with a big dog in a big house at the top of a big hill. In the backyard is a locked shed from which strange sounds emerge, as if some creature is trying to escape. When Mr. Bowditch dies, he leaves Charlie the house, a massive amount of gold, a cassette tape telling a story that is impossible to believe, and a responsibility far too massive for a boy to shoulder. Because within the shed is a portal to another worldone whose denizens are in peril and whose monstrous leaders may destroy their own world, and ours. In this parallel universe, where two moons race across the sky, and the grand towers of a sprawling palace pierce the clouds, there are exiled princesses and princes who suffer horrific punishments; there are dungeons; there are games in which men and women must fight each other to the death for the amusement of the Fair One. And there is a magic sundial that can turn back time. A story as old as myth, and as startling and iconic as the rest of Kings work, Fairy Tale is about an ordinary guy forced into the heros role by circumstance, and it is both spectacularly suspenseful and satisfying.","['Horror', 'Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Adventure']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1647789287i/60177373.jpg,1668002175,9781668002179,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60177373-fairy-tale,608.0,4.11,27985.0,Fairy Tale,235576.0

Each carries private wounds and powerful secrets as they head for Texas, following dangerous roads rife with ruthless vigilantes and soldiers still fighting a war lost a decade before. For Lavinia and Juneau Jane, the journey is one of inheritance and financial desperation, but for Hannie, torn from her mother and eight siblings before slavery's end, the pilgrimage westward reignites an agonizing question: Could her long-lost family still be out there?

Augustine, Louisiana, seems suspicious of new ideas and new people, and Benny can scarcely comprehend the lives of her poverty-stricken students.

After World War II, Don's work with the Air Force brought them to Colorado, where their twelve children perfectly spanned the baby boom: the oldest born in 1945, the youngest in 1965. In those years, there was an established script for a family like the Galvinsaspiration, hard work, upward mobility, domestic harmonyand they worked hard to play their parts. But behind the scenes was a different story: psychological breakdown, sudden shocking violence, hidden abuse. By the mid-1970s, six of the ten Galvin boys, one after another, were diagnosed as schizophrenic. How could all this happen to one family?What took place inside the house on Hidden Valley Road was so extraordinary that the Galvins became one of the first families to be studied by the National Institute of Mental Health. Their story offers a shadow history of the science of schizophrenia, from the era of institutionalization, lobotomy, and the schizophrenogenic mother to the search for genetic markers for the disease, always amid profound disagreements about the nature of the illness itself. And unbeknownst to the Galvins, samples of their DNA informed decades of genetic research that continues today, offering paths to treatment, prediction, and even eradication of the disease for future generations.With clarity and compassion, bestselling and award-winning author Robert Kolker uncovers one family's unforgettable legacy of suffering, love, and hope.","['History', 'Audiobook', 'Psychology', 'Medicine', 'Memoir', 'Mental Illness', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Mental Health', 'Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1569289026l/50088631.jpg,038554376X,9780385543767,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50088631-hidden-valley-road,377.0,4.16,12198.0,Hidden Valley Road: Inside the Mind of an American Family,122715.0

Barbara Kingsolver,English,"""Anyone will tell you the born of this world are marked from the get-out, win or lose.""Set in the mountains of southern Appalachia, this is the story of a boy born to a teenaged single mother in a single-wide trailer, with no assets beyond his dead father's good looks and copper-colored hair, a caustic wit, and a fierce talent for survival. In a plot that never pauses for breath, relayed in his own unsparing voice, he braves the modern perils of foster care, child labor, derelict schools, athletic success, addiction, disastrous loves, and crushing losses. Through all of it, he reckons with his own invisibility in a popular culture where even the superheroes have abandoned rural people in favor of cities.Many generations ago, Charles Dickens wrote David Copperfield from his experience as a survivor of institutional poverty and its damages to children in his society. Those problems have yet to be solved in ours. Dickens is not a prerequisite for readers of this novel, but he provided its inspiration. In transposing a Victorian epic novel to the contemporary American South, Barbara Kingsolver enlists Dickens' anger and compassion, and above all, his faith in the transformative powers of a good story. Demon Copperhead speaks for a new generation of lost boys, and all those born into beautiful, cursed places they can't imagine leaving behind.","['Novels', 'Book Club', 'Audiobook', 'Literary Fiction', 'Coming Of Age', 'Adult Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Fiction', 'Adult', 'Historical Fiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1660050779i/60194162.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60194162-demon-copperhead,560.0,4.51,42512.0,Demon Copperhead,403781.0

Sue Monk Kidd,English,"
  I am Ana. I was the wife of Jesus.
Raised in a wealthy family in Sepphoris with ties to the ruler of Galilee, Ana is rebellious and ambitious, a relentless seeker with a brilliant, curious mind and a daring spirit. She yearns for a pursuit worthy of her life, but finds no outlet for her considerable talents. Defying the expectations placed on women, she engages in furtive scholarly pursuits and writes secret narratives about neglected and silenced women. When she meets the eighteen-year-old Jesus, each is drawn to and enriched by the others spiritual and philosophical ideas. He becomes a floodgate for her intellect, but also the awakener of her heart.Their marriage unfolds with love and conflict, humor and pathos in Nazareth, where Ana makes a home with Jesus, his brothers, James and Simon, and their mother, Mary. Here, Anas pent-up longings intensify amid the turbulent resistance to the Roman occupation of Israel, partially led by her charismatic adopted brother, Judas. She is sustained by her indomitable aunt Yaltha, who is searching for her long-lost daughter, as well as by other women, including her friend Tabitha, who is sold into slavery after she was raped, and Phasaelis, the shrewd wife of Herod Antipas. Anas impetuous streak occasionally invites danger. When one such foray forces her to flee Nazareth for her safety shortly before Jesuss public ministry begins, she makes her way with Yaltha to Alexandria, where she eventually finds refuge and purpose in unexpected surroundings.Grounded in meticulous historical research and written with a reverential approach to Jesuss life that focuses on his humanity, The Book of Longings is an inspiring account of one womans bold struggle to realize the passion and potential inside her, while living in a time, place, and culture devised to silence her.","['Adult', 'Book Club', 'Audiobook', 'Literary Fiction', 'Religion', 'Feminism', 'Adult Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1570801291l/52698452.jpg,052542976X,9780525429760,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52698452-the-book-of-longings,416.0,4.24,15330.0,The Book of Longings,123947.0

Notes about successes and failures, joys and sorrows, things that made me marvel, and things that made me laugh out loud. How to be fair. How to have less stress. How to have fun. How to hurt people less. How to get hurt less. How to be a good man. How to have meaning in life. How to be more me. Recently, I worked up the courage to sit down with those diaries. I found stories I experienced, lessons I learned and forgot, poems, prayers, prescriptions, beliefs about what matters, some great photographs, and a whole bunch of bumper stickers. I found a reliable theme, an approach to living that gave me more satisfaction, at the time, and still: If you know how, and when, to deal with lifes challenges - how to get relative with the inevitable - you can enjoy a state of success I call catching greenlights. So I took a one-way ticket to the desert and wrote this book: an album, a record, a story of my life so far. This is fifty years of my sights and seens, felts and figured-outs, cools and shamefuls. Graces, truths, and beauties of brutality. Getting away withs, getting caughts, and getting wets while trying to dance between the raindrops. Hopefully, its medicine that tastes good, a couple of aspirin instead of the infirmary, a spaceship to Mars without needing your pilots license, going to church without having to be born again, and laughing through the tears. Its a love letter. To life. Its also a guide to catching more greenlights - and to realizing that the yellows and reds eventually turn green too. Good luck.","['Self Help', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Personal Development', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Autobiography', 'Adult']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1604281659i/52838315.jpg,0593139135,9780593139134,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52838315-greenlights,289.0,4.21,35436.0,Greenlights,330003.0

Hilary Mantel,English,"With The Mirror &amp; the Light, Hilary Mantel brings to a triumphant close the trilogy she began with her peerless, Booker Prize-winning novels, Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies. She traces the final years of Thomas Cromwell, the boy from nowhere who climbs to the heights of power, offering a defining portrait of predator and prey, of a ferocious contest between present and past, between royal will and a common mans vision: of a modern nation making itself through conflict, passion and courage.The story begins in May 1536: Anne Boleyn is dead, decapitated in the space of a heartbeat by a hired French executioner. As her remains are bundled into oblivion, Cromwell breakfasts with the victors. The blacksmiths son from Putney emerges from the springs bloodbath to continue his climb to power and wealth, while his formidable master, Henry VIII, settles to short-lived happiness with his third queen, Jane Seymour.Cromwell, a man with only his wits to rely on, has no great family to back him, no private army. Despite rebellion at home, traitors plotting abroad and the threat of invasion testing Henrys regime to the breaking point, Cromwells robust imagination sees a new country in the mirror of the future. All of England lies at his feet, ripe for innovation and religious reform. But as fortunes wheel turns, Cromwells enemies are gathering in the shadows. The inevitable question remains: how long can anyone survive under Henrys cruel and capricious gaze?Eagerly awaited and eight years in the making, The Mirror &amp; the Light completes Cromwells journey from self-made man to one of the most feared, influential figures of his time. Portrayed by Mantel with pathos and terrific energy, Cromwell is as complex as he is unforgettable: a politician and a fixer, a husband and a father, a man who both defied and defined his age.","['Novels', 'Audiobook', 'British Literature', 'Literary Fiction', '16th Century', 'Literature', 'Tudor Period', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1612201530i/54860229.jpg,1250182492,9781250182494,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54860229-the-mirror-the-light,759.0,4.39,5311.0,The Mirror & the Light,39171.0

Erik Larson,English,"On Winston Churchill's first day as prime minister, Adolf Hitler invaded Holland and Belgium. Poland and Czechoslovakia had already fallen, and the Dunkirk evacuation was just two weeks away. For the next twelve months, Hitler would wage a relentless bombing campaign, killing 45,000 Britons. It was up to Churchill to hold his country together and persuade President Franklin Roosevelt that Britain was a worthy ally--and willing to fight to the end.In The Splendid and the Vile, Erik Larson shows how Churchill taught the British people ""the art of being fearless."" It is a story of political brinkmanship, but it's also an intimate domestic drama, set against the backdrop of Churchill's prime-ministerial country home, Chequers; his wartime retreat, Ditchley, where he and his entourage go when the moon is brightest and the bombing threat is highest; and of course 10 Downing Street in London. Drawing on diaries, original archival documents, and once-secret intelligence reports--some released only recently--Larson provides a new lens on London's darkest year through the day-to-day experience of Churchill and his family: his wife, Clementine; their youngest daughter, Mary, who chafes against her parents' wartime protectiveness; their son, Randolph, and his beautiful, unhappy wife, Pamela; Pamela's illicit lover, a dashing American emissary; and the advisers in Churchill's ""Secret Circle,"" to whom he turns in the hardest moments.","['History', 'World War II', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'War', 'Biography Memoir', 'British Literature', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Historical']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1567638164l/51187948.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51187948-the-splendid-and-the-vile,546.0,4.3,11900.0,"The Splendid and the Vile: A Saga of Churchill, Family, and Defiance During the Blitz",116276.0

Douglas   Stuart,English,"Shuggie Bain is the unforgettable story of young Hugh ""Shuggie"" Bain, a sweet and lonely boy who spends his 1980s childhood in run-down public housing in Glasgow, Scotland. Thatcher's policies have put husbands and sons out of work, and the city's notorious drugs epidemic is waiting in the wings. Shuggie's mother Agnes walks a wayward path: she is Shuggie's guiding light but a burden for him and his siblings. She dreams of a house with its own front door while she flicks through the pages of the Freemans catalogue, ordering a little happiness on credit, anything to brighten up her grey life. Married to a philandering taxi-driver husband, Agnes keeps her pride by looking good--her beehive, make-up, and pearly-white false teeth offer a glamourous image of a Glaswegian Elizabeth Taylor. But under the surface, Agnes finds increasing solace in drink, and she drains away the lion's share of each week's benefits--all the family has to live on--on cans of extra-strong lager hidden in handbags and poured into tea mugs. Agnes's older children find their own ways to get a safe distance from their mother, abandoning Shuggie to care for her as she swings between alcoholic binges and sobriety. Shuggie is meanwhile struggling to somehow become the normal boy he desperately longs to be, but everyone has realized that he is ""no right,"" a boy with a secret that all but him can see. Agnes is supportive of her son, but her addiction has the power to eclipse everyone close to her--even her beloved Shuggie.A heartbreaking story of addiction, sexuality, and love, Shuggie Bain is an epic portrayal of a working-class family that is rarely seen in fiction. Recalling the work of Edouard Louis, Alan Hollinghurst, Frank McCourt, and Hanya Yanagihara, it is a blistering debut by a brilliant novelist who has a powerful and important story to tell.","['Novels', 'Audiobook', 'Queer', 'LGBT', 'Literary Fiction', 'Scotland', 'Contemporary', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1602094778i/52741293.jpg,0802148042,9780802148049,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52741293-shuggie-bain,430.0,4.31,17069.0,Shuggie Bain,152355.0

Barack Obama,English,"A riveting, deeply personal account of history in the makingfrom the president who inspired us to believe in the power of democracy. In the stirring, highly anticipated first volume of his presidential memoirs, Barack Obama tells the story of his improbable odyssey from young man searching for his identity to leader of the free world, describing in strikingly personal detail both his political education and the landmark moments of the first term of his historic presidencya time of dramatic transformation and turmoil. Obama takes readers on a compelling journey from his earliest political aspirations to the pivotal Iowa caucus victory that demonstrated the power of grassroots activism to the watershed night of November 4, 2008, when he was elected 44th president of the United States, becoming the first African American to hold the nations highest office. Reflecting on the presidency, he offers a unique and thoughtful exploration of both the awesome reach and the limits of presidential power, as well as singular insights into the dynamics of U.S. partisan politics and international diplomacy. Obama brings readers inside the Oval Office and the White House Situation Room, and to Moscow, Cairo, Beijing, and points beyond. We are privy to his thoughts as he assembles his cabinet, wrestles with a global financial crisis, takes the measure of Vladimir Putin, overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds to secure passage of the Affordable Care Act, clashes with generals about U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, tackles Wall Street reform, responds to the devastating Deepwater Horizon blowout, and authorizes Operation Neptunes Spear, which leads to the death of Osama bin Laden. A Promised Land is extraordinarily intimate and introspectivethe story of one mans bet with history, the faith of a community organizer tested on the world stage. Obama is candid about the balancing act of running for office as a Black American, bearing the expectations of a generation buoyed by messages of hope and change, and meeting the moral challenges of high-stakes decision-making. He is frank about the forces that opposed him at home and abroad, open about how living in the White House affected his wife and daughters, and unafraid to reveal self-doubt and disappointment. Yet he never wavers from his belief that inside the great, ongoing American experiment, progress is always possible. This beautifully written and powerful book captures Barack Obamas conviction that democracy is not a gift from on high but something founded on empathy and common understanding and built together, day by day.","['History', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir', 'Presidents', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Autobiography', 'Adult']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1604286292i/55359022.jpg,1524763160,9781524763169,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55359022-a-promised-land,751.0,4.34,19861.0,A Promised Land,228078.0

When Gaspery-Jacques Roberts, a detective in the black-skied Night City, is hired to investigate an anomaly in the North American wilderness, he uncovers a series of lives upended: The exiled son of an earl driven to madness, a writer trapped far from home as a pandemic ravages Earth, and a childhood friend from the Night City who, like Gaspery himself, has glimpsed the chance to do something extraordinary that will disrupt the timeline of the universe. A virtuoso performance that is as human and tender as it is intellectually playful, Sea of Tranquility is a novel of time travel and metaphysics that precisely captures the reality of our current moment.'","['Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Literary Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Adult', 'Historical Fiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1626710416i/58446227.jpg,0593321448,9780593321447,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58446227-sea-of-tranquility,259.0,4.08,28184.0,Sea of Tranquility,232793.0

Isabel Wilkerson,English,"The Pulitzer Prizewinning, bestselling author of The Warmth of Other Suns examines the unspoken caste system that has shaped America and shows how our lives today are still defined by a hierarchy of human divisions.As we go about our daily lives, caste is the wordless usher in a darkened theater, flashlight cast down in the aisles, guiding us to our assigned seats for a performance. The hierarchy of caste is not about feelings or morality. It is about powerwhich groups have it and which do not.In this brilliant book, Isabel Wilkerson gives us a masterful portrait of an unseen phenomenon in America as she explores, through an immersive, deeply researched narrative and stories about real people, how America today and throughout its history has been shaped by a hidden caste system, a rigid hierarchy of human rankings.Beyond race, class, or other factors, there is a powerful caste system that influences peoples lives and behavior and the nations fate. Linking the caste systems of America, India, and Nazi Germany, Wilkerson explores eight pillars that underlie caste systems across civilizations, including divine will, bloodlines, stigma, and more. Using riveting stories about peopleincluding Martin Luther King, Jr., baseballs Satchel Paige, a single father and his toddler son, Wilkerson herself, and many othersshe shows the ways that the insidious undertow of caste is experienced every day. She documents how the Nazis studied the racial systems in America to plan their out-cast of the Jews; she discusses why the cruel logic of caste requires that there be a bottom rung for those in the middle to measure themselves against; she writes about the surprising health costs of caste, in depression and life expectancy, and the effects of this hierarchy on our culture and politics. Finally, she points forward to ways America can move beyond the artificial and destructive separations of human divisions, toward hope in our common humanity.","['History', 'Audiobook', 'Social Justice', 'Race', 'Sociology', 'African American', 'American History', 'Nonfiction', 'Anti Racist', 'Historical']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1597267568i/51152447.jpg,0593230256,9780593230251,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51152447-caste,544.0,4.54,19010.0,Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents,137696.0

Worse, she can't seem to move past the horrors of the war with Hybern and all she lost in it.The one person who ignites her temper more than any other is Cassian, the battle-scarred warrior whose position in Rhysand and Feyre's Night Court keeps him constantly in Nesta's orbit. But her temper isn't the only thing Cassian ignites. The fire between them is undeniable, and only burns hotter as they are forced into close quarters with each other.Meanwhile, the treacherous human queens who returned to the Continent during the last war have forged a dangerous new alliance, threatening the fragile peace that has settled over the realms. And the key to halting them might very well rely on Cassian and Nesta facing their haunting pasts.Against the sweeping backdrop of a world seared by war and plagued with uncertainty, Nesta and Cassian battle monsters from within and without as they search for acceptance-and healing-in each other's arms.","['Fae', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Magic', 'Romance', 'Fantasy', 'Fantasy Romance', 'Adult', 'New Adult']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1602570691i/53138095.jpg,168119628X,9781681196282,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53138095-a-court-of-silver-flames,757.0,4.47,98966.0,A ​Court of Silver Flames,1101449.0

Brit Bennett,English,"The Vignes twin sisters will always be identical. But after growing up together in a small, southern black community and running away at age sixteen, it's not just the shape of their daily lives that is different as adults, it's everything: their families, their communities, their racial identities. Many years later, one sister lives with her black daughter in the same southern town she once tried to escape. The other passes for white, and her white husband knows nothing of her past. Still, even separated by so many miles and just as many lies, the fates of the twins remain intertwined. What will happen to the next generation, when their own daughters' storylines intersect?Weaving together multiple strands and generations of this family, from the Deep South to California, from the 1950s to the 1990s, Brit Bennett produces a story that is at once a riveting, emotional family story and a brilliant exploration of the American history of passing.

Ben  Rhodes,English,"Why is democracy so threatened in America and around the world? And what can we do about it? A former White House aide and close confidante to President Barack Obama -- and New York Times bestselling author of The World as It Is -- travels the globe in a deeply personal, beautifully observed quest for answers. In 2017, as Ben Rhodes was helping Barack Obama begin his next chapter, the legacy they worked to build for eight years was being taken apart. To understand what was happening in America, Rhodes decided to look outward. Over the next three years, he traveled to dozens of countries, meeting with politicians, activists, and dissidents confronting the same nationalism and authoritarianism that was tearing America apart. Along the way, a Russian opposition leader he spends time with is poisoned, the Hong Kong protesters he comes to know see their movement snuffed out, and America itself reaches the precipice of losing democracy before giving itself a second chance.  Equal parts memoir and reporting, After the Fall is a hugely ambitious and essential work of discovery. Throughout, Rhodes comes to realize how much Americas fingerprints are on a world we helped to shape: through the excesses of our post-Cold War embrace of unbridled capitalism, post-9/11 nationalism and militarism, mania for technology and social media, and the racism that shaped the backlash to the Obama presidency. At the same time, he learns from a diverse set of characters - from Obama to rebels to a rising generation of leaders - how looking squarely at where America has gone wrong only makes it more essential to fight for what America is supposed to be at home - for our own country, and the entire world.","['History', 'Politics', 'Government', 'Audiobook', 'Social Justice', 'Memoir', 'American', 'American History', 'Nonfiction', 'Political Science']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1618256944i/56466928.jpg,1984856057,9781984856050,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56466928-after-the-fall,358.0,4.21,466.0,After the Fall: Being American in the World We've Made,4364.0

Days later, David found William dead from an accidental drug overdose.Now, in a memoir suggestive of Augusten Burroughs meets Glennon Doyle, award-winning columnist and author David Magee answers his son's wish with a compelling, heartbreaking, and impossible to put down book that speaks to every individual and family.With honesty and heart, Magee shares his family's intergenerational struggle with substance abuse and mental health issues, as well as his own reckoning with family secretsconfronting the dark truth about the adoptive parents who raised him and a decades-long search for identity. He wrestles with personal substance misuse that began at a young age and, as a father, he sees destructive patterns repeat and develop within his own children. While striving to find a truly authentic voice as a writer despite authoring nearly a dozen previous books, Magee ultimately understands that William had been right and their own family's history is the story he needs to tell.A poignant and uplifting message of hope translates unimaginable tragedy into an inspirational commitment to saving others, as David founded the William Magee Institute for Student Wellbeing at the University of Mississippi. His mission to share solutions to self-medication and addiction, particularly as it touches America's high school and college students, emphasizes that William's story is about much more than a tragic addictionit's an American story of a family broken by loss and remade with love.Dear William inspires readers to find purpose, build resilience, and break the cycles that damage too many individuals and the people who love them.

Dane C. Ortlund,English,"Christians know that God loves them, but often think that he is perpetually disappointed and frustrated, maybe even close to giving up on them. As a result, they focus a lot on what Jesus has done to appease God's wrath for sin. But how does Jesus Christ actually feel about his people amid all their sins and failures? This book draws us to Matthew 11, where Jesus describes himself as ""gentle and lowly in heart,"" longing for his people to find rest in him. The gospel is primarily about God's heart drawn to his people, a heart of tender love for the sinful and suffering. These chapters take readers into the depths of Christ's very heart for sinners, diving deep into Bible passages that speak of who Christ is and encouraging readers with the affections of Christ for his people. His longing heart for sinners will comfort and sustain readers in their up-and-down lives.","['Spirituality', 'Christianity', 'Audiobook', 'Theology', 'Religion', 'Christian Living', 'Nonfiction', 'Faith', 'Christian', 'Christian Non Fiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1571689979l/52891090.jpg,1433566133,9781433566134,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52891090-gentle-and-lowly,224.0,4.53,5336.0,Gentle and Lowly: The Heart of Christ for Sinners and Sufferers,41304.0

Chris Hedges,English,"An unflinching indictment of the horror and obscenity of war by one of our finest war correspondents.Drawn from experience and interviews by Pulitzer-prize-winner Chris Hedges, this book looks at the hidden costs of war, what it does to individuals, families, communities and nations.In fifteen short chapters, Chris Hedges astonishes us with his clear and cogent argument against war, not on philosophical grounds or through moral arguments, but in an irrefutable stream of personal encounters with the victims of war, from veterans and parents to gravely wounded American serviceman who served in the Iraq War, to survivors of the Holocaust, to soldiers in the Falklands War, among others. Hedges reported from Sarajevo, and was in the Balkans to witness the collapse of the Soviet Union.In 2002 he published War Is a Force that Gives Us Meaning , which the Los Angeles Times described as the best kind of war journalism bitterly poetic and ruthlessly philosophical and the New York Times called a brilliant, thoughtful, timely, and unsettling book. In the twenty years since, Hedges has not wanted to write another book on the subject of waruntil now, with the outbreak of war in Ukraine. It is important again to be reminded who are the victors of the spoils of war and of other unerring truths, not only in this war but in all modern wars, where civilians are always the main victims, and the tools and methods of war are capable of so much destruction it boggles the mind.

John McWhorter,English,"People of good will on both the left and the right are secretly asking themselves the same question: how has the conversation on race gone so crazy?Bestselling author and acclaimed linguist John McWhorter argues that an illiberal neoracism, disguised as antiracism, is hurting black communities and weakening the social fabric.We're told to read books and listen to music by people of colour but that wearing certain clothes is 'appropriation.' We hear that being white automatically gives you privilege and that being black makes you a victim. We want to speak up but fear we'll be seen as unwoke, or worse, labelled a racist. According to John McWhorter, the problem is that a well-meaning but pernicious form of antiracism has become, not a progressive ideology, but a religion - and one that's illogical, unreachable, and unintentionally neoracist.In Woke Racism, McWhorter reveals the workings of this new religion, from the original sin of 'white privilege' and the weaponization of cancel culture to ban heretics, to the evangelical fervour of the 'woke mob.' He shows how this religion that claims to 'dismantle racist structures' is actually harming his fellow black Americans by infantilizing black people, setting black students up for failure, and passing policies that disproportionately damage black communities. The new religion might be called 'antiracism, ' but it features a racial essentialism that's barely distinguishable from racist arguments of the past.Fortunately, for all of us, it's not too late to push back against woke racism. McWhorter shares scripts and encouragement with those trying to deprogramme friends and family. And most importantly, he offers a roadmap to justice that actually will help, not hurt, black people.A NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER","['Politics', 'Cultural', 'Audiobook', 'Social Justice', 'Race', 'Sociology', 'Religion', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Society']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1621840442i/58133534.jpg,0593423062,9780593423066,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58133534-woke-racism,224.0,3.94,1005.0,Woke Racism: How a New Religion Has Betrayed Black America,5863.0

Louise Perry,English,"Ditching the stuffy hang-ups and benighted sexual traditionalism of the past is an unambiguously positive thing.The sexual revolution has liberated us to enjoy a heady mixture of erotic freedom and personal autonomy.Right? Wrong, argues Louise Perry in her provocative new book.Although it would be neither possible nor desirable to turn the clock back to a world of pre-60s sexual mores, she argues that the amoral libertinism and callous disenchantment of liberal feminism and our contemporary hypersexualised culture represent more loss than gain.The main winners from a world of rough sex, hook-up culture and ubiquitous porn - where anything goes and only consent matters - are a tiny minority of high-status men, not the women forced to accommodate the excesses of male lust.While dispensing sage advice to the generations paying the price for these excesses, she makes a passionate case for a new sexual culture built around dignity, virtue and restraint. This countercultural polemic from one of the most exciting young voices in contemporary feminism should be read by all men and women uneasy about the mindless orthodoxies of our ultraliberal era.","['Gender', 'Politics', 'Cultural', 'Psychology', 'Sexuality', 'Sociology', 'Feminism', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Society']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1648679668i/59852733.jpg,1509549994,9781509549993,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59852733-the-case-against-the-sexual-revolution,200.0,4.29,434.0,The Case Against the Sexual Revolution: A New Guide to Sex in the 21st Century,2442.0

Paul Manafort,English,"A WALL STREET JOURNAL, USA TODAY, and PUBLISHERS WEEKLY NATIONAL BESTSELLER NEW BOOK CLAIMS DONALD TRUMP WILL RUN AND WIN IN 2024! A riveting account of the HOAX that sent a presidential campaign chairman to solitary confinement because he wouldnt turn against the President of the United States.  The chief weapon deployed by the government-corporate-media Establishment against the Trump presidency was propaganda.Time and again, allegations from anonymous sources were disseminatedby a partisan media, promoted by a dishonest Democrat Party leadership, and ultimately debunked when the facts surfaced. But by the time the truth came out, it was too late. There had already been casualties.  One of the highest profile casualties was Paul Manafort.  Desperate to defeat Donald Trumpor hamper his presidency after he wonDemocrats and their Establishment allies colluded with foreign operatives to concoct a completely false narrative about Pauls supposed conspiracy with pro-Russian elements in Ukraine to further Vladimir Putins efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. But it wasnt just defamation of Pauls character. They took the unprecedented step of enlisting the US intelligence and law enforcement communities in using their power against President Trump and his campaign team. Political Prisonerfinally exposes the lies left unchallenged by media who pronounced Paul guilty long before his case ever saw the inside of a courtroom. Not only is it untrue that Victor Yanukovych or any of Pauls clients were pro-Putin, it is the opposite of the truth. Pauls work in Ukraine and throughout his career was 100 percent aligned with US interests in the countries he worked in, sometimes even acting as a back channel for the White House itself.  Neither was Paul guilty of laundering money, evading taxes, or deliberately deceiving the US government by failing to register as a foreign agentwhich he wasnt. These were all politically motivated charges manufactured by the Special Counsels team for one reason and one reason to get Paul to testify against Donald Trump about a conspiracy that never existed. When they hear the basis of these spurious charges, Americans will wonder what country they are living in and what has happened to our system of justice. Political Prisonertells the real story of Pauls life and career, exploding the lies about his work in Ukraine, his previous work with foreign governments and business interests in other countries, his involvement with the Trump campaign, and the process crimes for which he was wrongly convicted and sent to prison. It is no exaggeration to say that everything most Americans think they know about Paul Manafort is false.

Bernie Taupin,English,"** NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER**An evocative, clear-eyed, and revealing memoir by Bernie Taupin, the lyrical master and long-time collaborator of Elton JohnI loved writing, I loved chronicling life and every moment I was cogent, sober, or blitzed, I was forever feeding off my surroundings, making copious notes as ammunition for future compositions. . . . The thing is good, bad, or indifferent I never stopped writing, it was as addictive as any drug.This is the memoir music fans have been waiting for. Half of one of the greatest creative partnerships in popular music, Bernie Taupin is the man who wrote the lyrics for Elton John, who conceived the ideas that spawned countless hits, and sold millions and millions of records. Together, they were a duo, a unit, an immovable object. Their extraordinary, half-century-and-counting creative relationship has been chronicled in biopics (like 2019's Rocketman ) and even John's own autobiography, Me . But Taupin, a famously private person, has kept his own account of their adventures close to his chest, until now.Written with honesty and candor, Scattershot allows the reader to witness events unfolding from Taupin's singular perspective, sometimes front and center, sometimes from the edge, yet always described vibrantly, with an infectious energy that only a vivid songwriter's prose could offer. From his childhood in the East Midlands of England whose imagination was sparked and forever informed by the distinctly American mythopoetics of country music and cowboy culture, to the glittering, star-studded fishbowl of 70s and 80s Beverly Hills, Scattershot is simultaneously a Tom Jones- like picaresque journey across a landscape of unforgettable characters, as well as a striking, first-hand account of a creative era like no other and one mans experience at the core of it.An exciting, multi-decade whirlwind told in a non-linear yet grounded narrative, Scattershot whizzes around the world as we ride shotgun with Bernie on his extraordinary life. We visit Los Angeles with him and Elton on the cusp of global fame. We spend time with him in Australia almost in residency at an infamous rock 'n' roll hotel in an endless blizzard of drugs. And we spend late, late night hours with John Lennon, with Bob Marley, and hanging with Frank Sinatra. And beyond the world of popular music, we witness memorable encounters with writers like Graham Greene, painters like Andy Warhol and Salvador Dali, and scores of notable misfits, miscreants, eccentrics, and geniuses, known and unknown. Even if they're not famous in their own right, they are stars on the page, and we discover how they inspired the indelible lyrics to songs such as Tiny Dancer, Candle in the Wind, Bennie and The Jets, and so many more.Unique and utterly compelling, Scattershot will transport the reader across the decades and around the globe, along the way meeting some of the greatest creative minds of the 20th century, and into the vivid imaginings of one of music's most legendary lyricists.","['Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir', 'British Literature', 'Music', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Autobiography']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1682981462i/85157765.jpg,0306828677,9780306828676,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85157765-scattershot,416.0,3.58,255.0,"Scattershot: Life, Music, Elton, and Me",1365.0
