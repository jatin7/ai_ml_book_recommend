The lender has foreclosed on all Caerphilly's public buildings, and all employees have evacuated except one. Phineas Throckmorton, the town clerk, has been barricaded in the courthouse basement for over a year.Mr. Throckmorton's long siege has only been possible because of a pre-Civil War tunnel leading from the courthouse basement to a crawl space beneath the bandstand.

Gyles Brandreth,English,"(UK title: Oscar Wilde and the Candlelight Murders). Published in the USA simultaneously in hardcover and paperback.Lovers of historical mystery will relish this chilling Victorian tale based on real events and cloaked in authenticity. Best of all, it casts British literature's most fascinating and controversial figure as the lead sleuth. A young artist's model has been murdered, and legendary wit Oscar Wilde enlists his friends Arthur Conan Doyle and Robert Sherard to help him investigate. But when they arrive at the scene of the crime they find no sign of the gruesome killing -- save one small spatter of blood, high on the wall.

Ariana Franklin,English,"A chilling, mesmerizing novel that combines the best of modern forensic thrillers with the detail and drama of historical fiction. In medieval Cambridge, England, four children have been murdered. The crimes are immediately blamed on the town's Jewish community, taken as evidence that Jews sacrifice Christian children in blasphemous ceremonies. To save them from the rioting mob, the king places the Cambridge Jews under his protection and hides them in a castle fortress. King Henry II is no friend of the Jews-or anyone, really-but he is invested in their fate. Without the taxes received from Jewish merchants, his treasuries would go bankrupt. Hoping scientific investigation will exonerate the Jews, Henry calls on his cousin the King of Sicily-whose subjects include the best medical experts in Europe-and asks for his finest ""master of the art of death,"" an early version of the medical examiner. The Italian doctor chosen for the task is a young prodigy from the University of Salerno. But her name is Adelia-the king has been sent a ""mistress"" of the art of death. Adelia and her companions-Simon, a Jew, and Mansur, a Moor-travel to England to unravel the mystery of the Cambridge murders, which turn out to be the work of a serial killer, most likely one who has been on Crusade with the king. In a backward and superstitious country like England, Adelia must conceal her true identity as a doctor in order to avoid accusations of witchcraft. Along the way, she is assisted by Sir Rowley Picot, one of the king's tax collectors, a man with a personal stake in the investigation. Rowley may be a needed friend, or the fiend for whom they are searching. As Adelia's investigation takes her into Cambridge's shadowy river paths and behind the closed doors of its churches and nunneries, the hunt intensifies and the killer prepares to strike again . .","['Medieval', 'British Literature', 'Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Historical', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Thriller', 'Historical Fiction', 'Historical Mystery', 'Crime']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1435958507i/86643.jpg,0399154140,9780399154140,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/86643.Mistress_of_the_Art_of_Death,384.0,3.93,3253.0,Mistress of the Art of Death,39700.0

It seemed that everything was not how it should be, or at least, how it appeared. Unfaithful housewives, a football coach fixing game scores, a crooked private detective and eventually a murder, would bring exposure to SUnset 4. And that was something its operators didn't want. Carson isn't involved in the investigation, but it seems everyone thinks he is. Protecting a friend, he tries hard to ignore things that are simply not right. Finally, he follows instinct and tackles the innocent and the guilty in SUnset 4.",,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1337784823i/14165337.jpg,1462639534,9781462639533,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14165337-sunset-4,222.0,5.0,1.0,Sunset 4,5.0

"Libby Lynch, Gerald W. Darnell",English,"It was a disaster beyond most peoples comprehension. There was nothing left standing of the barn, it had burned completely to the ground. Among the rubble and smoking wood, you could see the smoking corpses - which had once been some of the finest thoroughbred stallions in the Tennessee and Kentucky area. Unnoticed, among these ruins, were the burned remains of Aaron Nunamaker, owner of Nunamaker Stables, and one of the best known horse breeders and stud farm owners in West Tennessee.Killing a human being brings the wrath of the law and the accompanying sorrow and grief from loved ones. Killing a helpless animal brings wrath that is unequaled to that associated with killing a person. This sorrow and grief continues long after the grief over human loss has left. Mankind will forget their own losses, but they never forget similar betrayals to animals. Odd isnt it?The fire had, obviously, been set and was a deliberate murder of innocent animals - horses. Horses, that could not free themselves from their comfortable stable, horses that trusted their caregiver and felt safe in their home. Horses that died a terrible death, and horses that would never know how they became involved in such a terrible scheme and plan.Tracks reveled that many of the doomed horses had been led from another barn to the one that was burned. This made it more than an act of revenge or rage, but one intended to destroy the animals, all at once, and all at one time.Other than car and horse tracks, the clues were minimal or non-existent. Police roped off the area and considered it an accident or a rival/revenge act, until they found the body. Then things changed.He had been shot once at close range with a high powered rifle. The bullet entered his center chest and exited to some unknown parts of the barn or maybe the surrounding ground. His body was burned beyond normal recognition, like the horses, but his engraved Horseshoe ring, which he always wore proudly on his right hand ring finger, made preliminary identification possible.",,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1394281428i/21087013.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21087013-horse-tales,202.0,5.0,,Horse Tales,5.0

Karen Owen Mystery BloggerAuthor ""Vicki Vass takes me back to the first mysteries I ever readNancy Drew."" By Lisa Ks Book Reviews ""There were so many twists and turns that I was not able to figure out who did it until the end of the book. I like that because it makes me want to read faster to see what happens next"" Griperang's Bookmarks A cross genre mix of historical fiction and paranormal mystery, Bloodline by Vicki Vass is the first book in her A Witch Cat Mystery series. Set in two different locations; Salem, Massachusetts during the witch trials of the early 1690; s and contemporary Ashville, North Carolina, Ms. Vass uses the local folklore of both locations to build her story. Well-developed characters, two interesting mysteries and a solid pace kept me turning the pages from start to finish. While there are two separate mysteries, only one will be resolved by the end of the story. The secondary mystery will undoubtedly be something that is carried as an ongoing thread throughout the series. Ms. Vass does a good job dropping clues for the reader to gather and the story takes plenty of twists and turns. The storys pace is fairly quick and Ms. Vasss voice as an author is well established and easy to read.

Gerald W. Darnell,English,"The witness protection program had simply not worked as promised. He and his wife had been relocated to a one horse hick town in West Tennessee, with a promise to start life over - on the right side of the law, this time.His factory job lasted less than a year. A strike and major labor dispute had cost him his job - and his running around with other women had cost him his wife. He never intended for any of this to happen, but it seemed he was meeting failure at every turn. He had made that difficult move from the underworld to the real world with all good intentions of making it stick - it wasn't working. Things were dragging him back, and he was finding it too easy to drift into the dark side of life once again. He knew that if he crossed back over, all chances and opportunity for a life in the real world were over - his one chance gone forever. While he resisted, it just didn't seem to matter - circumstances were taking him back - he couldn't stop himself.He started by renewing some old contacts, asking the right questions and finally by offering his services for hire. It didn't take long for things to happen, and contract offers coming his way.They started with a call from Anthony 'Tony' Scarsetti. He had worked for Tony in the past, and he believed they held a mutual respect for each other - him for his skills and Tony for his leadership. Tony was a rival of Steve Carrollton, and their competition for the vices in Memphis and on Beale Street was well known. Evidently, Carrollton had been temporarily sidelined - but his operations continued. Tony was looking for some professional help to make his temporary situation a permanent one.Once again in his life, things were looking up and he was feeling good about himself - being useful. His skills were needed and he would again be a contributor. His little house on Mullins Avenue, in this hick town of Humboldt, would also be useful. Quiet, out of the main activity in Memphis, and allowing him to operate under the radar. Besides, the government had bought it, why not put it to good use?He would start by sharpening the skills that had once made him successful. After all, failure was not an option in this business - only death. Hours in the local forests and woods would give him the privacy required - he had the perfect set-up and the perfect location. Nobody local to challenge him, and besides, if someone did - he was still the best at what he did. Everybody knew that.~The tickets arrived to his post office box in a medium size brown envelope. American Airlines First Class to Miami and a First Class Cabin for a cruise to the Bahamas. It also contained $5,000 in large bills - more would be paid when the job was complete. He'd never been on a cruise before. In fact, the largest boat he'd ever been on was one he and his brother used for cat fishing when he was a kid. Things were good again. He wasn't going to make the same mistakes he had made in the past.

Walter Mosley,English,"In this cycle of 14 bittersweet stories, Walter Mosley breaks out of the genre--if not the setting--of his bestselling Easy Rawlins detective novels. Only eight years after serving out a prison sentence for murder, Socrates Fortlow lives in a tiny, two-room Watts apartment, where he cooks on a hot plate, scavenges for bottles, drinks and wrestles with his demons. Struggling to control a seemingly boundless rage--as well as the power of his massive ""rock-breaking"" hands--Socrates must find a way to live an honourable life as a black man on the margins of a white world, a task which takes every ounce of self-control he has.  Easy Rawlins fans might initially find themselves disappointed by the absence of a mystery to unravel. But it's a gripping inner drama that unfolds over the pages of these stories, as Socrates comes to grips with the chaos, poverty and violence around him. He tries to get and keep a job delivering groceries; takes in a young street kid named Darryl, who has his own murder to hide; and helps drive out the neighbourhood crack dealer. Throughout, Mosley captures the rhythms of Watts life in prose both lyrical and hard-edged, resulting in a haunting look at a life bounded by lust, violence, fear and a ruthlessly unsentimental moral vision.","['African American', 'Audiobook', 'Noir', 'Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Novels', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Short Stories', 'Crime', 'Literary Fiction']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348622123i/84557.jpg,1852427027,9781852427023,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/84557.Always_Outnumbered_Always_Outgunned,208.0,4.18,351.0,"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned",4226.0

"James H. Kiser, Gerald W. Darnell",English,"Tammy continued to work through her 30th week of pregnancy; then she spent the next 6 weeks in bed. It was an extremely difficult delivery, and the baby, a boy, lived for only two days. According to the doctor, the baby was born with a serious heart defect, which could not have been prevented. He assured Tammy that her work, activities and personal care had nothing to do with the death of the baby  she didnt believe him. Neither did Sonny.That was the end for Tammy and Sonny. They never forgave themselves and they never forgave each other.Tammys job at Alton Box was gone and now she needed something to keep herself busy and away from Sonny. Her brother, Richie, told her that Skeeters in Jackson was looking for some inside and outside waitresses, and Tammy couldnt get there fast enough to complete an application. Skeeters is a restaurant similar to Chiefs, except they dont offer rooms or cabins for rent. They do offer inside dining, a bar and outside curb service  just like Chiefs. What they offered Tammy was a way to get away from Sonny, Humboldt and the bad memories. What it also offered was an opportunity to meet other people, lots of people. For Tammy, it was also a chance to meet other men, and she did a lot of that.It was two days before anyone reported Tammy missing. Sunday and Monday were her days off and she always spent Monday visiting with her parents. When she missed her Monday visit, her father, Thomas Whitmore, called her house all day  no answer. He finally reached Sonny that afternoon, and Sonny told him that she had changed her work schedule and was working. Her father didnt accept that answer, and Mr. Whitmore called the sheriffs office to report Tammy as missing. The sheriffs office collected information and made the usual and necessary calls. However, when she didnt report for her shift at Skeeters on Tuesday, her boss called her father to inquire about her absence. Thats when her father learned Tammy had definitely not worked on Monday, and in fact, had not worked since the previous Saturday.Tammy had not been seen by anyone since finishing her shift at Skeeters at 1:00 AM Saturday night; however, it didnt take long for the sheriff, Leroy Epsee, and his deputies to find Tammy.Crossing Rexall Drug Store, owned by Dr. Parker Williams and Dr. Whitley Johnson, is just around the corner from Blues Pool Room. Blues Pool Room is a popular hangout for many of the residents of the Crossing, and many of the male colored citizens of Humboldt grew up inside the walls of Blues Pool Room. While the poolroom and the drug store dont have much in common, they do share a trash dumpster located in the alley area behind both businesses. It was here where they found Tammy.Jack Cooley, better known as Jack the Rack, worked at Blues Pool Room as a rack boy and step and fetch-it for most of the patrons. It was his weekly responsibility to make sure all the trash was placed in the alley garbage dumpster for Tuesdays collection day. Behind the dumpster, among all the discarded boxes and trash, is where he found Tammy Blurton. She was naked, except for an extremely bloodstained, short sleeve, blue work shirt with Henry on the red name label above the left pocket. Tammy had been beaten, strangled, stabbed and presumably raped. It would be four days before the coroner could determine the exact cause of death.Leroys crime scene investigators did a good job and eventually located a large knife among the scattered trash bags. It was an eight- inch, butcher-type knife and had what appeared to be bloodstains on the blade. They also found a small slip of paper in the pocket of the shirt Tammy was wearing; it contained a name and phone number.Henry Walker SUnset 4  2031.",,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1613499907i/23637279.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23637279-the-crossing,,4.67,1.0,The Crossing,6.0

Mrs. Greg Washburn) knows the importance of not mixing business and private life -- that's why she has two names, for crying out loud. But when Mrs. Washburn's best friend, Wynell, begs for a part in Ms. Timberlake's new venture -- redecorating a very upscale bed-and-breakfast -- Abby breaks that cardinal rule and agrees. Since Abby deals with interiors, and Wynnell is to handle the garden, personal and professional peace is maintained, at least until Abby points out the utter tastelessness of the replica of Michelangelo's David that Wynnell has chosen for the garden's focal point. After exchanging heated words, as only southern ladies can, the pair stop speaking to each other entirely -- until Wynnell calls Abby from jail, where she's under arrest for fatally attacking the B&amp;B owner with the tacky statue! Wynnell's taste in garden sculpture may be deplorable, but that's hardly a criminal offense. To prove her friend's innocence, Abby turns her finely honed research skills on the other suspects at the scene of the crime, like the not-so-grieving widower or the strange guests. Until justice is done, Abby refuses to be distracted by her personal tribulations, which include her mother's decision to open a tearoom in Abby's home and the return of her prodigal brother, who is sporting a clerical collar and aggressively brandishing the new leaf he's supposedly turned over.

James Runcie,English,"It is 1953, the coronation year of Queen Elizabeth II. Sidney Chambers, vicar of Grantchester and honorary canon of Ely Cathedral, is a thirty-two-year-old bachelor. Tall, with dark brown hair, eyes the color of hazelnuts, and a reassuringly gentle manner, Sidney is an unconventional clerical detective. He can go where the police cannot.Together with his roguish friend, inspector Geordie Keating, Sidney inquires into the suspect suicide of a Cambridge solicitor, a scandalous jewelry theft at a New Year's Eve dinner party, the unexplained death of a jazz promoter's daughter, and a shocking art forgery that puts a close friend in danger. Sidney discovers that being a detective, like being a clergyman, means that you are never off duty, but he nonetheless manages to find time for a keen interest in cricket, warm beer, and hot jazz - as well as a curious fondness for a German widow three years his junior.With a whiff of Agatha Christie and a touch of G. K. Chesterton's Father Brown, The Grantchester Mysteries introduces a wonderful new hero into the world of detective fiction.","['British Literature', 'Cozy Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Historical', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Short Stories', 'Historical Fiction', 'Historical Mystery', 'Crime']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348886863i/13166684.jpg,1608198561,9781608198566,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13166684-sidney-chambers-and-the-shadow-of-death,392.0,3.68,1354.0,Sidney Chambers and the Shadow of Death,9140.0

And the alchemist's descendant-her employer, Gabriel Jones-has the eyes of a sorcerer.But despite Venetia's intent to seduce Mr. Jones and move on, she is shattered upon her return home to read in the press of his violent demise.

Lea Wait,English,"Ignorance is truly bliss for recently widowed Maggie Summer, owner of Shadows Antiques, when she arrives at the prestigious Rensselaer County Spring Antiques Fair. Sadly, she won't remain ignorant of the suspiciously high mortality rate among her fellow antiques dealers for long.Rumors are everywhere. The most recent victim, John Smithson, died of poison at a show just last week, and many of the same dealers are here at Rensselaer. They make the identical circuit year after year, so they know each other well. Or do they?Murder is still far from Maggie's mind as she arranges her Shadows booth: some Currier &amp; Ives prints here, Winslow Homer wood engravings on the hack wall, other prints arranged on tables and easels by category. With eleven years' experience, she knows her stock. So far the worst thing that has happened was putting the wrong price tag on a Homer engraving and having to sell it for $170 instead of $1,700.Maggie doesn't intend for that to happen again, and she doesn't intend to worry about murder. This show's security is tight. But she can't help observing her colleagues with fresh eyes. Some, Eke Gussie White in the booth next door, are dear friends, and Gussie's assistant, her twenty-year-old nephew, Ben, who has Down's syndrome, is a delightful new acquaintance. Others, however, even people she's known for years, suddenly seem suspect.The opening night wine has hardly stopped flowing when death claims another victim.

Worse, the motel has been in desperate need of an update since the 80s and is overlooked by travelers thanks to GPS maps routing away potential customers.

Amelia Peabody was unabashedly proud of her newest translation, a fragment of the ancient fairytale ""The Doomed Prince."" Later, she would wonder why no sense of foreboding struck her as she retold the story of the king's favorite son who had been warned that he would die from the snake, the crocodile, or the dog. Little did she realize, as she and her beloved husband sailed blissfully toward the pyramids of ancient Egypt, that those very beasts (and a cat as well) would be part of a deadly plot. The expedition began so happily....Leaving their delightful, but catastrophically precocious, son, Ramses, back in England, Amelia hoped this romantic trip might rejuvenate her thirteen-year-old marriage and bring back the thrills that she feared were fading.

Janet Evanovich,English,"Dear Reader:In a previous life, before the time of Plum, I wrote twelve short romance novels. Red-hot screwball comedies, each and every one of them. Nine of these stories were originally published by the Loveswept line between the years 1988 and 1992. All immediately went out of print and could be found only at used bookstores and yard sales.I'm excited to tell you that those nine stories are now being re-released by HarperCollins. Naughty Neighbor is the eighth in the lineup, and it's presented here in almost original form. Usually when I edit these books I do some modernizing. For instance, I change VHS to DVD, and roller skates to Rollerblades, and sticks of gum are now pieces of gum. I do this because the books were meant to be contemporary (as opposed to historical), and I don't want the reader to have a time disconnect. In the beginning of the original Naughty Neighbor, my heroine throws a handheld phone into the toilet, and the next morning she goes into the bathroom and sees the ""slim silver antenna caught between the toilet lid and seat."" Okay, so most phones don't have extended antennas anymore, but I just loved the image . . . so I left it in. And I don't know how many women wear front-closure bras anymore, but that got left in, too.Naughty Neighbor is probably the most romancey of all the Loveswepts I wrote, but there's still a small mystery to unravel. Louisa Brannigan is a no-nonsense, hardworking press secretary, fighting her way to the top of Capitol Hill, with no help from her annoying neighbor, Pete Streeter. He receives phone calls all night long, he steals her morning paper, he thinks jeans are formal wear, and worst of all he's involved Louisa in the disappearance of a pig. So this is the story of a pig in Witness Protection and love being found by a workaholic woman and a fun-loving man who makes terrible pots of coffee.Enjoy!Janet Evanovich","['Audiobook', 'Romance', 'Comedy', 'Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Chick Lit', 'Adult', 'Contemporary Romance', 'Humor', 'Contemporary']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388327293i/1577167.jpg,0060598921,9780060598921,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1577167.Naughty_Neighbor,229.0,3.68,637.0,Naughty Neighbor,13626.0

She has vowed to keep him at arm's length until he can rid himself of his socialite fiancee, but she can't pass up the chance to take advantage of his offer of a real detective job.

In Tough Cookie, Davidson's ninth culinary mystery, Goldy is waiting to reopen her catering business, which has been shut down by the health department for lack of adequate drains. She's got a PBS cooking gig for a few weeks, and is trying to build a reputation as a personal chef, but she's desperate for a little extra Christmas cash, so she agrees to sell a pair of vintage skis to Doug Portman, a local art critic and former sort-of-romantic interest.  When Portman's killed in a skiing accident at Killdeer Resort with Goldy nearby, the police treat her with suspicion. It turns out that Portman was the easily persuaded head of the Parole Board, and Goldy's ex-husband (a.k.a. The Jerk, who was imprisoned for domestic violence) is coming up for parole. But when Goldy herself narrowly escapes a chilly death after her van is forced off a snowy highway, she starts looking for connections and steps into a minefield of unsolved murders, including the three-year-old avalanche death of her friend Nate Bullock. There're a multitude of suspicious characters lurking around Killdeer: Barton Reed, a crazy ex-con who sent Portman a letter loaded with poison; Arthur Wakefield, whose wealthy mother was also killed in a skiing accident at Killdeer; Jack Gilkey, a handsome young chef who was convicted of manslaughter in the death of Wakefield's mother (and released by Portman); Boots Faraday, a local artist; and even Rorry Bullock, Nate's angry widow.

Lucie Montgomery's semiestranged brother, Eli, calls her in France to tell her their father, Leland, has been killed in a hunting accident on the family's five-hundred-acre Virginia vineyard just as the fall harvest is about to begin. By the time he calls, Eli has already made funeral arrangements with what Lucie argues is indecent haste.It is an emotional trip home -- the first since an automobile accident two years ago, which left Lucie disabled and dependent on a cane. Her family's once elegant home and winery are now shabby and run-down, thanks to her father's penchant for fringy business deals. Eli, also cash-strapped and desperate to support his new wife's extravagant lifestyle, has already convinced their rebellious younger sister, Mia, to sell the debt-ridden estate and reap the profits from the valuable land it sits on, overruling Lucie's protests.On the eve of the funeral Lucie's godfather, Fitz, a partner in the family business, tells her Leland's death was no accident. Whoever killed him was motivated by the potential sale of the vineyard. It is the last conversation she will have with Fitz. Now the lone holdout preventing the vineyard sale, Lucie realizes she's next in line for another ""accident.""

"Alan Sinfield, T J Spencer, William Shakespeare",English,"Perhaps the single most influential work of English drama, William Shakespeare's Hamlet is a timeless tragedy of the conflicted loyalties, madness, betrayal and terrible revenge. This Penguin Shakespeare edition is edited by T.J.B. Spencer with an introduction by Alan Sinfield. 'To be or not to be - that is the question' Something is rotten in the state of Denmark. When young prince Hamlet is confronted by his father's ghost on the battlements of Castle Elsinore, he is burdened with a terrible task: slay King Claudius, Hamlet's uncle, who the ghost alleges murdered him. Wrestling with his conscience, Hamlet feigns wild madness while plotting a brutal revenge, alienating his mother Queen Gertrude and spurning his lover Ophelia. But the act of insanity takes Hamlet perilously close to the reality, wreaking havoc on guilty and innocent alike. This book contains a general introduction to Shakespeare's life and Elizabethan theatre, a separate introduction to Hamlet, a chronology, suggestions for further reading, an essay by Paul Prescott discussing performance options on both stage and screen, and a commentary. William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was born to John Shakespeare and Mary Arden some time in late April 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon. He wrote about 38 plays (the precise number is uncertain), many of which are regarded as the most exceptional works of drama ever produced, including Romeo and Juliet (1595), Henry V (1599), Hamlet (1601), Othello (1604), King Lear (1606) and Macbeth (1606), as well as a collection of 154 sonnets, which number among the most profound and influential love-poetry in English. If you enjoyed Hamlet, you might like Shakespeare's Macbeth, also available in Penguin Shakespeare. 'It has everything - intrigue, romance, politics, violence, revenge, jealousy, wit.

  Every year, Yorktown, Virginia, relives its role in the Revolutionary War by celebrating the anniversary of the British surrender in 1781. This year, plans include a re-enactment of the original battle and a colonial craft fair. Meg Langslow has returned to her home town for the festivities--and to sell her wrought-iron works of art. Except, of course, for the pink-painted flamingos she reluctantly made for her mother's best friend--she's hoping to deliver them secretly, so she won't get a reputation as ""the blacksmith who makes those cute wrought-iron flamingos.""Besides, she has taken on another responsibility--making sure none of her fellow crafters ruin the historical authenticity of the fair with forbidden modern devices--like wrist watches, calculators, or cell phones. She's only doing it to keep peace with the mother of the man she loves.

    Unlike quite a number of people, Agatha had not given up on Christmas. To have the perfect Christmas had been a childhood dream whilst surviving a rough upbringing in a Birmingham slum. Holly berries glistened, snow fell gently outside, and inside, all was Dickensian jollity. And in her dreams, James Lacey kissed her under the mistletoe, and, like a middle-aged sleeping beauty, she would awake to passion once more....
  
  Agatha Raisin is bored. Her detective agency in the Cotswolds is thriving, but she'll scream if she has to deal with another missing cat or dog. Only two things seem to offer potential excitement: the upcoming Christmas festivities and her ex, James Lacey. This year she is sure that if she invites James to a really splendid, old-fashioned Christmas dinner, their love will rekindle like a warm Yule log. When a wealthy widow hires Agatha because she's convinced a member of her family is trying to kill her, Agatha is intrigued---especially when the widow drops dead after high tea at the manor house. Who in this rather sterile house, complete with fake family portraits, could have hated the old lady enough to poison her?

Lisa Lutz,English,"THEY'RE BAAAAACK.   Their first caper, The Spellman Files, was a New York Times bestseller and earned comparisons to the books of Carl Hiaasen and Janet Evanovich. Now the Spellmans, a highly functioning yet supremely dysfunctional family of private investigators, return in a sidesplittingly funny story of suspicion, surveillance, and surprise.   When Izzy Spellman, PI, is arrested for the fourth time in three months, she writes it off as a job hazard. She's been (obsessively) keeping surveillance on a suspicious next door neighbor (suspect's name: John Brown), convinced he's up to no good -- even if her parents (the management at Spellman Investigations) are not.   When the (displeased) management refuses to bail Izzy out, it is Morty, Izzy's octogenarian lawyer, who comes to her rescue. But before he can build a defense, he has to know the facts. Over weak coffee and diner sandwiches, Izzy unveils the whole truth and nothing but the truth -- as only she, a thirty-year-old licensed professional, can.   When not compiling Suspicious Behavior Reports on all her family members, staking out her neighbor, or trying to keep her sister, Rae, from stalking her ""best friend,"" Inspector Henry Stone, Izzy has been busy attempting to apprehend the copycat vandal whose attacks on Mrs. Chandler's holiday lawn tableaux perfectly and eerily match a series of crimes from 1991-92, when Izzy and her best friend, Petra, happened to be at their most rebellious and delinquent. As Curse of the Spellmans unfolds, it's clear that Morty may be on retainer, but Izzy is still very much on the case...er, cases -- her own and that of every other Spellman family member.   (Re)meet the Spellmans, a family in which eavesdropping is a mandatory skill, locks are meant to be picked, past missteps are never forgotten, and blackmail is the preferred form of negotiation -- all in the name of unconditional love.","['Detective', 'Audiobook', 'Adult Fiction', 'Comedy', 'Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Chick Lit', 'Humor', 'Adult']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328310527i/8161826.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8161826-curse-of-the-spellmans,448.0,4.04,1556.0,Curse of the Spellmans,19141.0

G.M. Malliet,English,"Having spent almost three years in the idyllic village of Nether Monkslip, Max Tudor is well acclimated to his post as vicar at the church of St. Edwolds. This quaint town seems to be the perfect new home for Max, who has fled a harrowing past serving in the British counter-intelligence agency, the MI5. Now he has found a measure of peace among urban escapees and yoga practitioners, artists and New Agers. But this serenity is quickly shattered when the highly vocal and unpopular president of the Womens Institute turns up dead at the Harvest Fayre. The death looks like an accident, but Maxs training as a former agent kicks in, and before long he suspects foul play. Max has ministered to the community long enough to be familiar with alliances and animosities among the residents, but this tragedy confounds him. It is impossible to believe anyone in his lovely hamlet capable of the crime, and yet given the victim, he must acknowledge that almost everyone in town had probably fantasized about the poor womans death. As Max becomes more intricately involved, the investigation stirs up memories hed rather not revisit; the demons from his past which led him to Nether Monkslip and the reason why he is so heavily invested in keeping it from harm. Agatha-award winning author G.M. Malliet first won over the mystery community with her St. Just trilogy, prompting critics to compare her to Golden Age greats like Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers.

But when her boss, Milo, simultaneously cuts her bartending hours and introduces her to a ""friend"" looking for a private eye, Izzy reluctantly finds herself with a new client. She assures herself that the case -- a suspicious husband who wants his wife tailed -- will be short and sweet, and will involve nothing more than the most boring of PI rituals: surveillance. But with each passing hour, Izzy finds herself with more questions than hard evidence.Meanwhile, Spellmania continues. Izzy's brother, David, the family's most upright member, has adopted an uncharacteristically unkempt appearance and attitude toward work, life, and Izzy. And their wayward youngest sister, Rae, a historic academic underachiever, aces the PSATs and subsequently offends her study partner and object of obsession, Detective Henry Stone, to the point of excommunication. The only unsurprising behavior comes from her parents, whose visits to Milo's bar amount to thinly veiled surveillance and artful attempts (read: blackmail) at getting Izzy to return to the Spellman Inc. fold.As the case of the wayward wife continues to vex her, Izzy's personal life -- and mental health -- seem to be disintegrating. Facing a housing crisis, she can't sleep, she can't remember where she parked her car, and, despite her shrinks' persistence, she can't seem to break through in her appointments. She certainly can't explain why she forgets dates with her lawyer's grandson, or fails to interpret the come-ons issued in an Irish brogue by Milo's new bartender.

Roe's friend and bodyguard, the long-legged, bikini-clad Angel Youngblood, is mowing the grass and Roe is reclining on a lounger when a small red-and-white plane flies low overhead and drops its unlikely debris more or less at Roe's feet. Roe's husband of two years, wealthy businessman Martin Bartell, immediately wonders if the killer chose his dumping place to send some kind of message to Roe. And the mystery deepens when two federal agents arrive in town to investigate the murder. It's only when Madeleine the cat provides a clue that Roe and Martin realize Roe herself may be in danger and that using Roe's yard as a temporary landfill for dead bodies was no accident.","['Audiobook', 'Cozy Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Romance', 'Crime', 'Adult', 'Contemporary']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1375777249i/140089.jpg,0786209852,9780786209859,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/140089.Dead_Over_Heels,267.0,3.8,699.0,Dead Over Heels,17744.0

But when one of the love connections she made is broken up by murder, Jaine finds herself freelancing free-of-charge--and uncovering more than she bargained for. . .No one seems to need her help more than geeky, gawky Howard Murdoch. His request is simple enough: a letter proclaiming his undying love for Stacy Lawrence, a gorgeous aerobics instructor.

Lisa Lutz,English,"Meet Isabel ""Izzy"" Spellman, private investigator. This twenty-eight-year-old may have a checkered past littered with romantic mistakes, excessive drinking, and creative vandalism; she may be addicted to Get Smart reruns and prefer entering homes through windows rather than doors -- but the upshot is she's good at her job as a licensed private investigator with her family's firm, Spellman Investigations. Invading people's privacy comes naturally to Izzy. In fact, it comes naturally to all the Spellmans. If only they could leave their work at the office. To be a Spellman is to snoop on a Spellman; tail a Spellman; dig up dirt on, blackmail, and wiretap a Spellman. Part Nancy Drew, part Dirty Harry, Izzy walks an indistinguishable line between Spellman family member and Spellman employee. Duties include: completing assignments from the bosses, aka Mom and Dad (preferably without scrutiny); appeasing her chronically perfect lawyer brother (often under duress); setting an example for her fourteen-year-old sister, Rae (who's become addicted to ""recreational surveillance""); and tracking down her uncle (who randomly disappears on benders dubbed ""Lost Weekends""). But when Izzy's parents hire Rae to follow her (for the purpose of ascertaining the identity of Izzy's new boyfriend), Izzy snaps and decides that the only way she will ever be normal is if she gets out of the family business. But there's a hitch: she must take one last job before they'll let her go -- a fifteen-year-old, ice-cold missing person case. She accepts, only to experience a disappearance far closer to home, which becomes the most important case of her life.","['Audiobook', 'Adult Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Chick Lit', 'Humor', 'Crime', 'Adult', 'Contemporary']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347521714i/129117.jpg,0743571355,9780743571357,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/129117.The_Spellman_Files,6.0,3.87,4095.0,The Spellman Files,35893.0

Peter Shandy has journeyed northward alone to escape his wife Helen's all-female house party and to go in search of some mysterious lupines - glorious great spikes of bloom that are reportedly growing where conditions should make their existence impossible. He takes a room at a quaint old inn in Pickwance, Maine, and is awaiting a serving of Indian pudding in the dining room when the town's most disliked citizen, Jasper Flodge, keels over, face first, into his chicken pot pie.

Shandy, however, is more intrigued by another enigma. He has located the lupines at an ancient farm owned by Frances Hodgson Rondel, a woman of great age and fixed opinions. Her plants are inexplicably lush, her hens are in glowing health, and she herself is as spry as a woman of forty.

Just as an unidentified element is making Miss Rondel's lupines bloom with incredible splendor, an unknown someone is turning love and hate, greed and lies, into fertile ground - for murder.","['Audiobook', 'Cozy Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Humor']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1178724399i/825994.jpg,0892964308,9780892964307,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/825994.Something_in_the_Water,262.0,3.94,45.0,Something in the Water,806.0

The next morning Meg isn't exactly surprised to find that someone has murdered him.But who? Some people's motives were obvious from the footage: the couple whose affair was revealed . . . the bombastic leader of the reenactors, who could be facing years in prison if the evidence from the video helps convict him of sheep stealing . . . the actress who's desperately trying to downplay a health issue that could cost her the role of her life. Other motives are only hinted at--did the filmmaker have other footage that would reveal why one of the actors is behaving so furtively?Unfortunately, whoever murdered Goodwin also destroyed all the electronic devices on which his video was stored. So Caerphilly's chief of police--and Meg--must rediscover the same secrets the filmmaker did if they want to catch a killer.","['Audiobook', 'Cozy Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Family', 'Humor', 'Animals', 'Adult', 'Contemporary']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1611925072i/54860358.jpg,125076016X,9781250760166,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54860358-murder-most-fowl,320.0,4.19,298.0,Murder Most Fowl,2194.0

"Gabriella Zinnas, Alison Golden",English," What would you do if you discovered a dead body? Would you investigate? Try to solve the case before the police arrive?  Would you prattle on about theories regarding the murder, realizing you know almost too much about it? Would you put the handsome detective off balance so that he then accuses you of being the murderer? All before 9AM? No surely no one would do that?  Clearly, you havent met Diana Hunter.  When embarking on an early morning run, Diana notices a man sitting on the ground reading a book. When she returns, she finds he hasnt moved a muscle since she left her house. She checks him over and discovers that he is stone cold. Once the emergency services arrive, all equipped with a very good-looking, but pompous detective, Peter Hopkinson, she has to continually prove to the detective why she is not the killer while trying to solve the murder herself.  Will Diana find the murderer before the detective does, or will they both discover that something a lot more sinister is going on at Royal Bay Beach?   Interview with the Author of the Series  Q - So, what makes the Diana Hunter series special?  A - When I set out to write these books, I wanted to create something that mirrored exactly the kind of books I like to read. My top picks are always mystery novels, especially featuring female protagonists with attitude. Diana is badass and I cant tell you how many readers tell me she reminds them of themselves. She makes you feel you can do anything!  The Diana Hunter books are a great mix of genres. There is nothing graphic or gratuitous in these books. Your Aunt Martha could definitely read them. But they are not roses around the cottage door type mysteries. They are more hard-boiled with some romantic tension, suspense and thriller action to keep things interesting!  Overall, the Diana Hunter series is designed to keep you turning the pages - and I've made sure there's never a dull moment.  Q - In what order should I read the books?  A - The Diana Hunter mysteries can be read and enjoyed in any order, however, Hunted is a prequel to the other books in the series. Unlike the other books, it is not a complete mystery. It relates the events that create the backdrop to the series and fills in some of Dianas personality and motivations. You dont have to have read the prequel to make sense of the later books but it helps.  Ive made sure not to include any spoilers for those who are new to the characters and any existing fans of Dianas adventures will still find plenty of fresh action and mystery as well as perhaps a few answers. All in all, there is something for everyone. The events in this prequel take place a few years before Snatched, the first book in the Diana Hunter series of mysteries.  If you do want to read them in order, I'd suggest the following sequence:  - Hunted (prequel) - Snatched - Stolen - Chopped  Q - So, why should readers give these books a try?  A - Because the Diana Hunter series is a fast, fun, thrill-ride that takes no prisoners! Our heroine is kicks butt but has a soft center. We want her to win out even when shes making poor decisions and alienating those who can, and want, to help her. I think most women will see a little, or a lot, of themselves in Diana Hunter.  Ultimately, readers who enjoy lightning-fast pacing with a plot that twists and turns all the way to the end will get a kick out of this series.","['Murder Mystery', 'Amazon', 'Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Suspense']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1452706140i/28534228.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28534228-snatched,136.0,3.92,97.0,Snatched,663.0

"Gabriella Zinnas, Alison Golden",English,"A survivor. A fighter. A threat.When Vancouver's elite convenes in the prestigious Four Seasons Hotel to celebrate and fund the new British Columbia Children's Hospital, it is a night of free flowing champagne, high class regalia and more flash than a museum could house - until suddenly everyone realizes all their precious jewels and baubles are gone.In the space of one moment the night turns from joy to confusion.... How did it happen? How were they all robbed, at once... without anyone seeing a thing?Diana Hunter works for a news and crime magazine, yet her past experience and impressive, Sherlock Holmes-like skills mark her as an asset only the government could have trained.Those skills are soon put to the test when the Superintendent of the Vancouver Police Department calls her in to work the case. Thrown together with a talented group, Diana must unravel the clues before the ghost like bandits strike again. With two successful heists behind them, Diana begins to fear the bigger picture and realizes that these 'robberies' may not just be robberies after all....Interview with the Author of the seriesQ - So, what makes the Diana Hunter series special?A - When I set out to write these books, I wanted to create something that mirrored exactly the kind of books I like to read. My top picks are always mystery novels, especially featuring female protagonists with attitude. Diana is badass and I can't tell you how many readers tell me she reminds them of themselves. She makes you feel you can do anything!The Diana Hunter books are a great mix of genres. There is nothing graphic or gratuitous in these books. Your Aunt Martha could definitely read them. But they are not ""roses around the cottage door"" -type mysteries. They are more hard-boiled with some romantic tension, suspense and thriller action to keep things interesting!Overall, the Diana Hunter series is designed to keep you turning the pages - and I've made sure there's never a dull moment.Q - In what order should I read the books?A - The Diana Hunter mysteries can be read and enjoyed in any order, however, Hunted is a prequel to the other books in the series. Unlike the other books, it is not a complete mystery. It relates the events that create the backdrop to the series and fills in some of Diana's personality and motivations. You don't have to have read the prequel to make sense of the later books but it will help to understand the sub plot more clearly.I've made sure not to include any spoilers for those who are new to the characters and any existing fans of Diana's adventures will still find plenty of fresh action and mystery as well as perhaps a few answers. All in all, there is something for everyone. The events in this prequel take place a few years before Snatched, the first book in the Diana Hunter series of mysteries.If you do want to read them in order, I'd suggest the following sequence:Hunted (prequel) Snatched Stolen (coming soon) Chopped (coming soon) Q - So, why should readers give these books a try?A - Because the Diana Hunter series is a fast, fun, thrill-ride that takes no prisoners! Our heroine kicks butt but has a soft center. We want her to win out even when she's making poor decisions and alienating those who can, and want, to help her. I think most women will see a little, or a lot, of themselves in Diana Hunter.Ultimately, readers who enjoy lightning-fast pacing with a plot that twists and turns all the way to the end will get a kick out of this series.Thanks for reading!","['Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Suspense', 'Mystery Thriller']",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1479939857i/31334462.jpg,1530979285,9781530979288,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31334462-stolen,224.0,4.03,82.0,Stolen,588.0

They know that they're certain to encounter the same petty thefts and confidence tricksters they're used to dealing with, though they hope identifying the culprits among the 500 or so passengers will prove a little easier than it does aboard the great 2,000 passenger Cunard ships.

Lavinia is also well versed in the practice of mesmerism, an extraordinary gift that far surpasses mere charm and physical appeal. Nobody knows this better than the usually coolheaded Tobias March, who seems to have fallen hopelessly under her spell. Fortunately for all, however, Lavinia uses her powers for good. And ever since a tragedy involving one of her subjects, she has even retired them in favor of her work with Lake and March, a joint venture providing discreet private inquiries for individuals of quality.

Sadly, her plans were cut short when she was murdered. Only a gentlemans cravat wound around her lovely neck remained for evidence--small compensation for the strange and priceless bracelet that may have been snatched from her wrist as she drew her last breath.As a result, Lake and March are soon in Howard Hudsons employ on the trail of the killer. But Tobias is convinced the dashing widower is more interested in tracking down the missing relic. If so, Howard is not alone. Any number of ruthless types are after the very same antiquity, whose centerpiece is an unusual blue cameo of inestimable value and supposed legendary powers--powers of immeasurable worth to anyone in Howards line of work.Together, Lake and March undertake a tantalizing investigation that leads them from the glittering ballrooms of the ton to Londons seediest taverns to a mesmerist whose therapies include treating ladies suffering from hysteria is a a most unconventional method--and, not least of all, to the darkest reaches of mens psyches.

But when nightfall comes, the toddler is still in residence and Karen isnt answering any phone calls. Meg decides she must find out whats happening, so the next morning, with Timmy in tow, she retraces her friends footsteps---and begins to suspect that Karens disappearance is tied to at least one serious crime.

The police dont seem to care, so Meg once again plays sleuth---this time with a toddler as her sidekick.
    As usual, Megs extended family adds to the complications in her life. What covert animal welfare project are Dad and the curmudgeonly zoologist Dr. Montgomery Blake working on---and will Meg have to make another late-night trip to bail them out of jail? Why does Megs brother keep disappearing---is he merely trying to avoid babysitting, or is he involved in something more mysterious? Will taking care of Timmy dampen newly married Meg and Michaels enthusiasm for starting a family of their own? And are any of Megs relatives reliable enough to be trusted with a two-year-old---especially a two-year-old whose whereabouts might be of interest to some very dangerous people?
    Donna Andrews once again proves her skill as one of the funniest, most entertaining mystery authors around.
